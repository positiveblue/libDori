the
valley
of
fear
by
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
part
the
tragedy
of
birlstone
chapter
the
warning
i
am
inclined
to
think
said
i
i
should
do
so
sherlock
holmes
remarked
impatiently
i
believe
that
i
am
one
of
the
most
long
suffering
of
mortals
but
i
ll
admit
that
i
was
annoyed
at
the
sardonic
interruption
really
holmes
said
i
severely
you
are
a
little
trying
at
times
he
was
too
much
absorbed
with
his
own
thoughts
to
give
any
immediate
answer
to
my
remonstrance
he
leaned
upon
his
hand
with
his
untasted
breakfast
before
him
and
he
stared
at
the
slip
of
paper
which
he
had
just
drawn
from
its
envelope
then
he
took
the
envelope
itself
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
very
carefully
studied
both
the
exterior
and
the
flap
it
is
porlock
s
writing
said
he
thoughtfully
i
can
hardly
doubt
that
it
is
porlock
s
writing
though
i
have
seen
it
only
twice
before
the
greek
e
with
the
peculiar
top
flourish
is
distinctive
but
if
it
is
porlock
then
it
must
be
something
of
the
very
first
importance
he
was
speaking
to
himself
rather
than
to
me
but
my
vexation
disappeared
in
the
interest
which
the
words
awakened
who
then
is
porlock
i
asked
porlock
watson
is
a
nom
de
plume
a
mere
identification
mark
but
behind
it
lies
a
shifty
and
evasive
personality
in
a
former
letter
he
frankly
informed
me
that
the
name
was
not
his
own
and
defied
me
ever
to
trace
him
among
the
teeming
millions
of
this
great
city
porlock
is
important
not
for
himself
but
for
the
great
man
with
whom
he
is
in
touch
picture
to
yourself
the
pilot
fish
with
the
shark
the
jackal
with
the
lion
anything
that
is
insignificant
in
companionship
with
what
is
formidable
not
only
formidable
watson
but
sinister
in
the
highest
degree
sinister
that
is
where
he
comes
within
my
purview
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
professor
moriarty
the
famous
scientific
criminal
as
famous
among
crooks
as
my
blushes
watson
holmes
murmured
in
a
deprecating
voice
i
was
about
to
say
as
he
is
unknown
to
the
public
a
touch
a
distinct
touch
cried
holmes
you
are
developing
a
certain
unexpected
vein
of
pawky
humour
watson
against
which
i
must
learn
to
guard
myself
but
in
calling
moriarty
a
criminal
you
are
uttering
libel
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
there
lie
the
glory
and
the
wonder
of
it
the
greatest
schemer
of
all
time
the
organizer
of
every
deviltry
the
controlling
brain
of
the
underworld
a
brain
which
might
have
made
or
marred
the
destiny
of
nations
that
s
the
man
but
so
aloof
is
he
from
general
suspicion
so
immune
from
criticism
so
admirable
in
his
management
and
self
effacement
that
for
those
very
words
that
you
have
uttered
he
could
hale
you
to
a
court
and
emerge
with
your
year
s
pension
as
a
solatium
for
his
wounded
character
is
he
not
the
celebrated
author
of
the
dynamics
of
an
asteroid
a
book
which
ascends
to
such
rarefied
heights
of
pure
mathematics
that
it
is
said
that
there
was
no
man
in
the
scientific
press
capable
of
criticizing
it
is
this
a
man
to
traduce
foul
mouthed
doctor
and
slandered
professor
such
would
be
your
respective
roles
that
s
genius
watson
but
if
i
am
spared
by
lesser
men
our
day
will
surely
come
may
i
be
there
to
see
i
exclaimed
devoutly
but
you
were
speaking
of
this
man
porlock
ah
yes
the
so
called
porlock
is
a
link
in
the
chain
some
little
way
from
its
great
attachment
porlock
is
not
quite
a
sound
link
between
ourselves
he
is
the
only
flaw
in
that
chain
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
test
it
but
no
chain
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
exactly
my
dear
watson
hence
the
extreme
importance
of
porlock
led
on
by
some
rudimentary
aspirations
towards
right
and
encouraged
by
the
judicious
stimulation
of
an
occasional
ten
pound
note
sent
to
him
by
devious
methods
he
has
once
or
twice
given
me
advance
information
which
has
been
of
value
that
highest
value
which
anticipates
and
prevents
rather
than
avenges
crime
i
cannot
doubt
that
if
we
had
the
cipher
we
should
find
that
this
communication
is
of
the
nature
that
i
indicate
again
holmes
flattened
out
the
paper
upon
his
unused
plate
i
rose
and
leaning
over
him
stared
down
at
the
curious
inscription
which
ran
as
follows
c
douglas
birlstone
birlstone
what
do
you
make
of
it
holmes
it
is
obviously
an
attempt
to
convey
secret
information
but
what
is
the
use
of
a
cipher
message
without
the
cipher
in
this
instance
none
at
all
why
do
you
say
in
this
instance
because
there
are
many
ciphers
which
i
would
read
as
easily
as
i
do
the
apocrypha
of
the
agony
column
such
crude
devices
amuse
the
intelligence
without
fatiguing
it
but
this
is
different
it
is
clearly
a
reference
to
the
words
in
a
page
of
some
book
until
i
am
told
which
page
and
which
book
i
am
powerless
but
why
douglas
and
birlstone
clearly
because
those
are
words
which
were
not
contained
in
the
page
in
question
then
why
has
he
not
indicated
the
book
your
native
shrewdness
my
dear
watson
that
innate
cunning
which
is
the
delight
of
your
friends
would
surely
prevent
you
from
inclosing
cipher
and
message
in
the
same
envelope
should
it
miscarry
you
are
undone
as
it
is
both
have
to
go
wrong
before
any
harm
comes
from
it
our
second
post
is
now
overdue
and
i
shall
be
surprised
if
it
does
not
bring
us
either
a
further
letter
of
explanation
or
as
is
more
probable
the
very
volume
to
which
these
figures
refer
holmes
s
calculation
was
fulfilled
within
a
very
few
minutes
by
the
appearance
of
billy
the
page
with
the
very
letter
which
we
were
expecting
the
same
writing
remarked
holmes
as
he
opened
the
envelope
and
actually
signed
he
added
in
an
exultant
voice
as
he
unfolded
the
epistle
come
we
are
getting
on
watson
his
brow
clouded
however
as
he
glanced
over
the
contents
dear
me
this
is
very
disappointing
i
fear
watson
that
all
our
expectations
come
to
nothing
i
trust
that
the
man
porlock
will
come
to
no
harm
dear
mr
holmes
he
says
i
will
go
no
further
in
this
matter
it
is
too
dangerous
he
suspects
me
i
can
see
that
he
suspects
me
he
came
to
me
quite
unexpectedly
after
i
had
actually
addressed
this
envelope
with
the
intention
of
sending
you
the
key
to
the
cipher
i
was
able
to
cover
it
up
if
he
had
seen
it
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
me
but
i
read
suspicion
in
his
eyes
please
burn
the
cipher
message
which
can
now
be
of
no
use
to
you
fred
porlock
holmes
sat
for
some
little
time
twisting
this
letter
between
his
fingers
and
frowning
as
he
stared
into
the
fire
after
all
he
said
at
last
there
may
be
nothing
in
it
it
may
be
only
his
guilty
conscience
knowing
himself
to
be
a
traitor
he
may
have
read
the
accusation
in
the
other
s
eyes
the
other
being
i
presume
professor
moriarty
no
less
when
any
of
that
party
talk
about
he
you
know
whom
they
mean
there
is
one
predominant
he
for
all
of
them
but
what
can
he
do
hum
that
s
a
large
question
when
you
have
one
of
the
first
brains
of
europe
up
against
you
and
all
the
powers
of
darkness
at
his
back
there
are
infinite
possibilities
anyhow
friend
porlock
is
evidently
scared
out
of
his
senses
kindly
compare
the
writing
in
the
note
to
that
upon
its
envelope
which
was
done
he
tells
us
before
this
ill
omened
visit
the
one
is
clear
and
firm
the
other
hardly
legible
why
did
he
write
at
all
why
did
he
not
simply
drop
it
because
he
feared
i
would
make
some
inquiry
after
him
in
that
case
and
possibly
bring
trouble
on
him
no
doubt
said
i
of
course
i
had
picked
up
the
original
cipher
message
and
was
bending
my
brows
over
it
it
s
pretty
maddening
to
think
that
an
important
secret
may
lie
here
on
this
slip
of
paper
and
that
it
is
beyond
human
power
to
penetrate
it
sherlock
holmes
had
pushed
away
his
untasted
breakfast
and
lit
the
unsavoury
pipe
which
was
the
companion
of
his
deepest
meditations
i
wonder
said
he
leaning
back
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
perhaps
there
are
points
which
have
escaped
your
machiavellian
intellect
let
us
consider
the
problem
in
the
light
of
pure
reason
this
man
s
reference
is
to
a
book
that
is
our
point
of
departure
a
somewhat
vague
one
let
us
see
then
if
we
can
narrow
it
down
as
i
focus
my
mind
upon
it
it
seems
rather
less
impenetrable
what
indications
have
we
as
to
this
book
none
well
well
it
is
surely
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
the
cipher
message
begins
with
a
large
does
it
not
we
may
take
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
is
the
particular
page
to
which
the
cipher
refers
so
our
book
has
already
become
a
large
book
which
is
surely
something
gained
what
other
indications
have
we
as
to
the
nature
of
this
large
book
the
next
sign
is
c
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
chapter
the
second
no
doubt
hardly
that
watson
you
will
i
am
sure
agree
with
me
that
if
the
page
be
given
the
number
of
the
chapter
is
immaterial
also
that
if
page
finds
us
only
in
the
second
chapter
the
length
of
the
first
one
must
have
been
really
intolerable
column
i
cried
brilliant
watson
you
are
scintillating
this
morning
if
it
is
not
column
then
i
am
very
much
deceived
so
now
you
see
we
begin
to
visualize
a
large
book
printed
in
double
columns
which
are
each
of
a
considerable
length
since
one
of
the
words
is
numbered
in
the
document
as
the
two
hundred
and
ninety
third
have
we
reached
the
limits
of
what
reason
can
supply
i
fear
that
we
have
surely
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
one
more
coruscation
my
dear
watson
yet
another
brain
wave
had
the
volume
been
an
unusual
one
he
would
have
sent
it
to
me
instead
of
that
he
had
intended
before
his
plans
were
nipped
to
send
me
the
clue
in
this
envelope
he
says
so
in
his
note
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
book
is
one
which
he
thought
i
would
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
for
myself
he
had
it
and
he
imagined
that
i
would
have
it
too
in
short
watson
it
is
a
very
common
book
what
you
say
certainly
sounds
plausible
so
we
have
contracted
our
field
of
search
to
a
large
book
printed
in
double
columns
and
in
common
use
the
bible
i
cried
triumphantly
good
watson
good
but
not
if
i
may
say
so
quite
good
enough
even
if
i
accepted
the
compliment
for
myself
i
could
hardly
name
any
volume
which
would
be
less
likely
to
lie
at
the
elbow
of
one
of
moriarty
s
associates
besides
the
editions
of
holy
writ
are
so
numerous
that
he
could
hardly
suppose
that
two
copies
would
have
the
same
pagination
this
is
clearly
a
book
which
is
standardized
he
knows
for
certain
that
his
page
will
exactly
agree
with
my
page
but
very
few
books
would
correspond
with
that
exactly
therein
lies
our
salvation
our
search
is
narrowed
down
to
standardized
books
which
anyone
may
be
supposed
to
possess
bradshaw
there
are
difficulties
watson
the
vocabulary
of
bradshaw
is
nervous
and
terse
but
limited
the
selection
of
words
would
hardly
lend
itself
to
the
sending
of
general
messages
we
will
eliminate
bradshaw
the
dictionary
is
i
fear
inadmissible
for
the
same
reason
what
then
is
left
an
almanac
excellent
watson
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
you
have
not
touched
the
spot
an
almanac
let
us
consider
the
claims
of
whitaker
s
almanac
it
is
in
common
use
it
has
the
requisite
number
of
pages
it
is
in
double
column
though
reserved
in
its
earlier
vocabulary
it
becomes
if
i
remember
right
quite
garrulous
towards
the
end
he
picked
the
volume
from
his
desk
here
is
page
column
two
a
substantial
block
of
print
dealing
i
perceive
with
the
trade
and
resources
of
british
india
jot
down
the
words
watson
number
thirteen
is
mahratta
not
i
fear
a
very
auspicious
beginning
number
one
hundred
and
twenty
seven
is
government
which
at
least
makes
sense
though
somewhat
irrelevant
to
ourselves
and
professor
moriarty
now
let
us
try
again
what
does
the
mahratta
government
do
alas
the
next
word
is
pig
s
bristles
we
are
undone
my
good
watson
it
is
finished
he
had
spoken
in
jesting
vein
but
the
twitching
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
bespoke
his
disappointment
and
irritation
i
sat
helpless
and
unhappy
staring
into
the
fire
a
long
silence
was
broken
by
a
sudden
exclamation
from
holmes
who
dashed
at
a
cupboard
from
which
he
emerged
with
a
second
yellow
covered
volume
in
his
hand
we
pay
the
price
watson
for
being
too
up
to
date
he
cried
we
are
before
our
time
and
suffer
the
usual
penalties
being
the
seventh
of
january
we
have
very
properly
laid
in
the
new
almanac
it
is
more
than
likely
that
porlock
took
his
message
from
the
old
one
no
doubt
he
would
have
told
us
so
had
his
letter
of
explanation
been
written
now
let
us
see
what
page
has
in
store
for
us
number
thirteen
is
there
which
is
much
more
promising
number
one
hundred
and
twenty
seven
is
is
there
is
holmes
s
eyes
were
gleaming
with
excitement
and
his
thin
nervous
fingers
twitched
as
he
counted
the
words
danger
ha
ha
capital
put
that
down
watson
there
is
danger
may
come
very
soon
one
then
we
have
the
name
douglas
rich
country
now
at
birlstone
house
birlstone
confidence
is
pressing
there
watson
what
do
you
think
of
pure
reason
and
its
fruit
if
the
green
grocer
had
such
a
thing
as
a
laurel
wreath
i
should
send
billy
round
for
it
i
was
staring
at
the
strange
message
which
i
had
scrawled
as
he
deciphered
it
upon
a
sheet
of
foolscap
on
my
knee
what
a
queer
scrambling
way
of
expressing
his
meaning
said
i
on
the
contrary
he
has
done
quite
remarkably
well
said
holmes
when
you
search
a
single
column
for
words
with
which
to
express
your
meaning
you
can
hardly
expect
to
get
everything
you
want
you
are
bound
to
leave
something
to
the
intelligence
of
your
correspondent
the
purport
is
perfectly
clear
some
deviltry
is
intended
against
one
douglas
whoever
he
may
be
residing
as
stated
a
rich
country
gentleman
he
is
sure
confidence
was
as
near
as
he
could
get
to
confident
that
it
is
pressing
there
is
our
result
and
a
very
workmanlike
little
bit
of
analysis
it
was
holmes
had
the
impersonal
joy
of
the
true
artist
in
his
better
work
even
as
he
mourned
darkly
when
it
fell
below
the
high
level
to
which
he
aspired
he
was
still
chuckling
over
his
success
when
billy
swung
open
the
door
and
inspector
macdonald
of
scotland
yard
was
ushered
into
the
room
those
were
the
early
days
at
the
end
of
the
s
when
alec
macdonald
was
far
from
having
attained
the
national
fame
which
he
has
now
achieved
he
was
a
young
but
trusted
member
of
the
detective
force
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
several
cases
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
his
tall
bony
figure
gave
promise
of
exceptional
physical
strength
while
his
great
cranium
and
deep
set
lustrous
eyes
spoke
no
less
clearly
of
the
keen
intelligence
which
twinkled
out
from
behind
his
bushy
eyebrows
he
was
a
silent
precise
man
with
a
dour
nature
and
a
hard
aberdonian
accent
twice
already
in
his
career
had
holmes
helped
him
to
attain
success
his
own
sole
reward
being
the
intellectual
joy
of
the
problem
for
this
reason
the
affection
and
respect
of
the
scotchman
for
his
amateur
colleague
were
profound
and
he
showed
them
by
the
frankness
with
which
he
consulted
holmes
in
every
difficulty
mediocrity
knows
nothing
higher
than
itself
but
talent
instantly
recognizes
genius
and
macdonald
had
talent
enough
for
his
profession
to
enable
him
to
perceive
that
there
was
no
humiliation
in
seeking
the
assistance
of
one
who
already
stood
alone
in
europe
both
in
his
gifts
and
in
his
experience
holmes
was
not
prone
to
friendship
but
he
was
tolerant
of
the
big
scotchman
and
smiled
at
the
sight
of
him
you
are
an
early
bird
mr
mac
said
he
i
wish
you
luck
with
your
worm
i
fear
this
means
that
there
is
some
mischief
afoot
if
you
said
hope
instead
of
fear
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
i
m
thinking
mr
holmes
the
inspector
answered
with
a
knowing
grin
well
maybe
a
wee
nip
would
keep
out
the
raw
morning
chill
no
i
won
t
smoke
i
thank
you
i
ll
have
to
be
pushing
on
my
way
for
the
early
hours
of
a
case
are
the
precious
ones
as
no
man
knows
better
than
your
own
self
but
but
the
inspector
had
stopped
suddenly
and
was
staring
with
a
look
of
absolute
amazement
at
a
paper
upon
the
table
it
was
the
sheet
upon
which
i
had
scrawled
the
enigmatic
message
douglas
he
stammered
birlstone
what
s
this
mr
holmes
man
it
s
witchcraft
where
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
did
you
get
those
names
it
is
a
cipher
that
dr
watson
and
i
have
had
occasion
to
solve
but
why
what
s
amiss
with
the
names
the
inspector
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
in
dazed
astonishment
just
this
said
he
that
mr
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
house
was
horribly
murdered
last
night
chapter
sherlock
holmes
discourses
it
was
one
of
those
dramatic
moments
for
which
my
friend
existed
it
would
be
an
overstatement
to
say
that
he
was
shocked
or
even
excited
by
the
amazing
announcement
without
having
a
tinge
of
cruelty
in
his
singular
composition
he
was
undoubtedly
callous
from
long
overstimulation
yet
if
his
emotions
were
dulled
his
intellectual
perceptions
were
exceedingly
active
there
was
no
trace
then
of
the
horror
which
i
had
myself
felt
at
this
curt
declaration
but
his
face
showed
rather
the
quiet
and
interested
composure
of
the
chemist
who
sees
the
crystals
falling
into
position
from
his
oversaturated
solution
remarkable
said
he
remarkable
you
don
t
seem
surprised
interested
mr
mac
but
hardly
surprised
why
should
i
be
surprised
i
receive
an
anonymous
communication
from
a
quarter
which
i
know
to
be
important
warning
me
that
danger
threatens
a
certain
person
within
an
hour
i
learn
that
this
danger
has
actually
materialized
and
that
the
person
is
dead
i
am
interested
but
as
you
observe
i
am
not
surprised
in
a
few
short
sentences
he
explained
to
the
inspector
the
facts
about
the
letter
and
the
cipher
macdonald
sat
with
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
his
great
sandy
eyebrows
bunched
into
a
yellow
tangle
i
was
going
down
to
birlstone
this
morning
said
he
i
had
come
to
ask
you
if
you
cared
to
come
with
me
you
and
your
friend
here
but
from
what
you
say
we
might
perhaps
be
doing
better
work
in
london
i
rather
think
not
said
holmes
hang
it
all
mr
holmes
cried
the
inspector
the
papers
will
be
full
of
the
birlstone
mystery
in
a
day
or
two
but
where
s
the
mystery
if
there
is
a
man
in
london
who
prophesied
the
crime
before
ever
it
occurred
we
have
only
to
lay
our
hands
on
that
man
and
the
rest
will
follow
no
doubt
mr
mac
but
how
do
you
propose
to
lay
your
hands
on
the
so
called
porlock
macdonald
turned
over
the
letter
which
holmes
had
handed
him
posted
in
camberwell
that
doesn
t
help
us
much
name
you
say
is
assumed
not
much
to
go
on
certainly
didn
t
you
say
that
you
have
sent
him
money
twice
and
how
in
notes
to
camberwell
post
office
did
you
ever
trouble
to
see
who
called
for
them
no
the
inspector
looked
surprised
and
a
little
shocked
why
not
because
i
always
keep
faith
i
had
promised
when
he
first
wrote
that
i
would
not
try
to
trace
him
you
think
there
is
someone
behind
him
i
know
there
is
this
professor
that
i
ve
heard
you
mention
exactly
inspector
macdonald
smiled
and
his
eyelid
quivered
as
he
glanced
towards
me
i
won
t
conceal
from
you
mr
holmes
that
we
think
in
the
c
i
d
that
you
have
a
wee
bit
of
a
bee
in
your
bonnet
over
this
professor
i
made
some
inquiries
myself
about
the
matter
he
seems
to
be
a
very
respectable
learned
and
talented
sort
of
man
i
m
glad
you
ve
got
so
far
as
to
recognize
the
talent
man
you
can
t
but
recognize
it
after
i
heard
your
view
i
made
it
my
business
to
see
him
i
had
a
chat
with
him
on
eclipses
how
the
talk
got
that
way
i
canna
think
but
he
had
out
a
reflector
lantern
and
a
globe
and
made
it
all
clear
in
a
minute
he
lent
me
a
book
but
i
don
t
mind
saying
that
it
was
a
bit
above
my
head
though
i
had
a
good
aberdeen
upbringing
he
d
have
made
a
grand
meenister
with
his
thin
face
and
gray
hair
and
solemn
like
way
of
talking
when
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
as
we
were
parting
it
was
like
a
father
s
blessing
before
you
go
out
into
the
cold
cruel
world
holmes
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
great
he
said
great
tell
me
friend
macdonald
this
pleasing
and
touching
interview
was
i
suppose
in
the
professor
s
study
that
s
so
a
fine
room
is
it
not
very
fine
very
handsome
indeed
mr
holmes
you
sat
in
front
of
his
writing
desk
just
so
sun
in
your
eyes
and
his
face
in
the
shadow
well
it
was
evening
but
i
mind
that
the
lamp
was
turned
on
my
face
it
would
be
did
you
happen
to
observe
a
picture
over
the
professor
s
head
i
don
t
miss
much
mr
holmes
maybe
i
learned
that
from
you
yes
i
saw
the
picture
a
young
woman
with
her
head
on
her
hands
peeping
at
you
sideways
that
painting
was
by
jean
baptiste
greuze
the
inspector
endeavoured
to
look
interested
jean
baptiste
greuze
holmes
continued
joining
his
finger
tips
and
leaning
well
back
in
his
chair
was
a
french
artist
who
flourished
between
the
years
and
i
allude
of
course
to
his
working
career
modern
criticism
has
more
than
indorsed
the
high
opinion
formed
of
him
by
his
contemporaries
the
inspector
s
eyes
grew
abstracted
hadn
t
we
better
he
said
we
are
doing
so
holmes
interrupted
all
that
i
am
saying
has
a
very
direct
and
vital
bearing
upon
what
you
have
called
the
birlstone
mystery
in
fact
it
may
in
a
sense
be
called
the
very
centre
of
it
macdonald
smiled
feebly
and
looked
appealingly
to
me
your
thoughts
move
a
bit
too
quick
for
me
mr
holmes
you
leave
out
a
link
or
two
and
i
can
t
get
over
the
gap
what
in
the
whole
wide
world
can
be
the
connection
between
this
dead
painting
man
and
the
affair
at
birlstone
all
knowledge
comes
useful
to
the
detective
remarked
holmes
even
the
trivial
fact
that
in
the
year
a
picture
by
greuze
entitled
la
jeune
fille
a
l
agneau
fetched
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
francs
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
at
the
portalis
sale
may
start
a
train
of
reflection
in
your
mind
it
was
clear
that
it
did
the
inspector
looked
honestly
interested
i
may
remind
you
holmes
continued
that
the
professor
s
salary
can
be
ascertained
in
several
trustworthy
books
of
reference
it
is
seven
hundred
a
year
then
how
could
he
buy
quite
so
how
could
he
ay
that
s
remarkable
said
the
inspector
thoughtfully
talk
away
mr
holmes
i
m
just
loving
it
it
s
fine
holmes
smiled
he
was
always
warmed
by
genuine
admiration
the
characteristic
of
the
real
artist
what
about
birlstone
he
asked
we
ve
time
yet
said
the
inspector
glancing
at
his
watch
i
ve
a
cab
at
the
door
and
it
won
t
take
us
twenty
minutes
to
victoria
but
about
this
picture
i
thought
you
told
me
once
mr
holmes
that
you
had
never
met
professor
moriarty
no
i
never
have
then
how
do
you
know
about
his
rooms
ah
that
s
another
matter
i
have
been
three
times
in
his
rooms
twice
waiting
for
him
under
different
pretexts
and
leaving
before
he
came
once
well
i
can
hardly
tell
about
the
once
to
an
official
detective
it
was
on
the
last
occasion
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
running
over
his
papers
with
the
most
unexpected
results
you
found
something
compromising
absolutely
nothing
that
was
what
amazed
me
however
you
have
now
seen
the
point
of
the
picture
it
shows
him
to
be
a
very
wealthy
man
how
did
he
acquire
wealth
he
is
unmarried
his
younger
brother
is
a
station
master
in
the
west
of
england
his
chair
is
worth
seven
hundred
a
year
and
he
owns
a
greuze
well
surely
the
inference
is
plain
you
mean
that
he
has
a
great
income
and
that
he
must
earn
it
in
an
illegal
fashion
exactly
of
course
i
have
other
reasons
for
thinking
so
dozens
of
exiguous
threads
which
lead
vaguely
up
towards
the
centre
of
the
web
where
the
poisonous
motionless
creature
is
lurking
i
only
mention
the
greuze
because
it
brings
the
matter
within
the
range
of
your
own
observation
well
mr
holmes
i
admit
that
what
you
say
is
interesting
it
s
more
than
interesting
it
s
just
wonderful
but
let
us
have
it
a
little
clearer
if
you
can
is
it
forgery
coining
burglary
where
does
the
money
come
from
have
you
ever
read
of
jonathan
wild
well
the
name
has
a
familiar
sound
someone
in
a
novel
was
he
not
i
don
t
take
much
stock
of
detectives
in
novels
chaps
that
do
things
and
never
let
you
see
how
they
do
them
that
s
just
inspiration
not
business
jonathan
wild
wasn
t
a
detective
and
he
wasn
t
in
a
novel
he
was
a
master
criminal
and
he
lived
last
century
or
thereabouts
then
he
s
no
use
to
me
i
m
a
practical
man
mr
mac
the
most
practical
thing
that
you
ever
did
in
your
life
would
be
to
shut
yourself
up
for
three
months
and
read
twelve
hours
a
day
at
the
annals
of
crime
everything
comes
in
circles
even
professor
moriarty
jonathan
wild
was
the
hidden
force
of
the
london
criminals
to
whom
he
sold
his
brains
and
his
organization
on
a
fifteen
per
cent
commission
the
old
wheel
turns
and
the
same
spoke
comes
up
it
s
all
been
done
before
and
will
be
again
i
ll
tell
you
one
or
two
things
about
moriarty
which
may
interest
you
you
ll
interest
me
right
enough
i
happen
to
know
who
is
the
first
link
in
his
chain
a
chain
with
this
napoleon
gone
wrong
at
one
end
and
a
hundred
broken
fighting
men
pickpockets
blackmailers
and
card
sharpers
at
the
other
with
every
sort
of
crime
in
between
his
chief
of
staff
is
colonel
sebastian
moran
as
aloof
and
guarded
and
inaccessible
to
the
law
as
himself
what
do
you
think
he
pays
him
i
d
like
to
hear
six
thousand
a
year
that
s
paying
for
brains
you
see
the
american
business
principle
i
learned
that
detail
quite
by
chance
it
s
more
than
the
prime
minister
gets
that
gives
you
an
idea
of
moriarty
s
gains
and
of
the
scale
on
which
he
works
another
point
i
made
it
my
business
to
hunt
down
some
of
moriarty
s
checks
lately
just
common
innocent
checks
that
he
pays
his
household
bills
with
they
were
drawn
on
six
different
banks
does
that
make
any
impression
on
your
mind
queer
certainly
but
what
do
you
gather
from
it
that
he
wanted
no
gossip
about
his
wealth
no
single
man
should
know
what
he
had
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
twenty
banking
accounts
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
abroad
in
the
deutsche
bank
or
the
credit
lyonnais
as
likely
as
not
sometime
when
you
have
a
year
or
two
to
spare
i
commend
to
you
the
study
of
professor
moriarty
inspector
macdonald
had
grown
steadily
more
impressed
as
the
conversation
proceeded
he
had
lost
himself
in
his
interest
now
his
practical
scotch
intelligence
brought
him
back
with
a
snap
to
the
matter
in
hand
he
can
keep
anyhow
said
he
you
ve
got
us
side
tracked
with
your
interesting
anecdotes
mr
holmes
what
really
counts
is
your
remark
that
there
is
some
connection
between
the
professor
and
the
crime
that
you
get
from
the
warning
received
through
the
man
porlock
can
we
for
our
present
practical
needs
get
any
further
than
that
we
may
form
some
conception
as
to
the
motives
of
the
crime
it
is
as
i
gather
from
your
original
remarks
an
inexplicable
or
at
least
an
unexplained
murder
now
presuming
that
the
source
of
the
crime
is
as
we
suspect
it
to
be
there
might
be
two
different
motives
in
the
first
place
i
may
tell
you
that
moriarty
rules
with
a
rod
of
iron
over
his
people
his
discipline
is
tremendous
there
is
only
one
punishment
in
his
code
it
is
death
now
we
might
suppose
that
this
murdered
man
this
douglas
whose
approaching
fate
was
known
by
one
of
the
arch
criminal
s
subordinates
had
in
some
way
betrayed
the
chief
his
punishment
followed
and
would
be
known
to
all
if
only
to
put
the
fear
of
death
into
them
well
that
is
one
suggestion
mr
holmes
the
other
is
that
it
has
been
engineered
by
moriarty
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
was
there
any
robbery
i
have
not
heard
if
so
it
would
of
course
be
against
the
first
hypothesis
and
in
favour
of
the
second
moriarty
may
have
been
engaged
to
engineer
it
on
a
promise
of
part
spoils
or
he
may
have
been
paid
so
much
down
to
manage
it
either
is
possible
but
whichever
it
may
be
or
if
it
is
some
third
combination
it
is
down
at
birlstone
that
we
must
seek
the
solution
i
know
our
man
too
well
to
suppose
that
he
has
left
anything
up
here
which
may
lead
us
to
him
then
to
birlstone
we
must
go
cried
macdonald
jumping
from
his
chair
my
word
it
s
later
than
i
thought
i
can
give
you
gentlemen
five
minutes
for
preparation
and
that
is
all
and
ample
for
us
both
said
holmes
as
he
sprang
up
and
hastened
to
change
from
his
dressing
gown
to
his
coat
while
we
are
on
our
way
mr
mac
i
will
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
all
about
it
all
about
it
proved
to
be
disappointingly
little
and
yet
there
was
enough
to
assure
us
that
the
case
before
us
might
well
be
worthy
of
the
expert
s
closest
attention
he
brightened
and
rubbed
his
thin
hands
together
as
he
listened
to
the
meagre
but
remarkable
details
a
long
series
of
sterile
weeks
lay
behind
us
and
here
at
last
there
was
a
fitting
object
for
those
remarkable
powers
which
like
all
special
gifts
become
irksome
to
their
owner
when
they
are
not
in
use
that
razor
brain
blunted
and
rusted
with
inaction
sherlock
holmes
s
eyes
glistened
his
pale
cheeks
took
a
warmer
hue
and
his
whole
eager
face
shone
with
an
inward
light
when
the
call
for
work
reached
him
leaning
forward
in
the
cab
he
listened
intently
to
macdonald
s
short
sketch
of
the
problem
which
awaited
us
in
sussex
the
inspector
was
himself
dependent
as
he
explained
to
us
upon
a
scribbled
account
forwarded
to
him
by
the
milk
train
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
white
mason
the
local
officer
was
a
personal
friend
and
hence
macdonald
had
been
notified
much
more
promptly
than
is
usual
at
scotland
yard
when
provincials
need
their
assistance
it
is
a
very
cold
scent
upon
which
the
metropolitan
expert
is
generally
asked
to
run
dear
inspector
macdonald
said
the
letter
which
he
read
to
us
official
requisition
for
your
services
is
in
separate
envelope
this
is
for
your
private
eye
wire
me
what
train
in
the
morning
you
can
get
for
birlstone
and
i
will
meet
it
or
have
it
met
if
i
am
too
occupied
this
case
is
a
snorter
don
t
waste
a
moment
in
getting
started
if
you
can
bring
mr
holmes
please
do
so
for
he
will
find
something
after
his
own
heart
we
would
think
the
whole
had
been
fixed
up
for
theatrical
effect
if
there
wasn
t
a
dead
man
in
the
middle
of
it
my
word
it
is
a
snorter
your
friend
seems
to
be
no
fool
remarked
holmes
no
sir
white
mason
is
a
very
live
man
if
i
am
any
judge
well
have
you
anything
more
only
that
he
will
give
us
every
detail
when
we
meet
then
how
did
you
get
at
mr
douglas
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
horribly
murdered
that
was
in
the
inclosed
official
report
it
didn
t
say
horrible
that
s
not
a
recognized
official
term
it
gave
the
name
john
douglas
it
mentioned
that
his
injuries
had
been
in
the
head
from
the
discharge
of
a
shotgun
it
also
mentioned
the
hour
of
the
alarm
which
was
close
on
to
midnight
last
night
it
added
that
the
case
was
undoubtedly
one
of
murder
but
that
no
arrest
had
been
made
and
that
the
case
was
one
which
presented
some
very
perplexing
and
extraordinary
features
that
s
absolutely
all
we
have
at
present
mr
holmes
then
with
your
permission
we
will
leave
it
at
that
mr
mac
the
temptation
to
form
premature
theories
upon
insufficient
data
is
the
bane
of
our
profession
i
can
see
only
two
things
for
certain
at
present
a
great
brain
in
london
and
a
dead
man
in
sussex
it
s
the
chain
between
that
we
are
going
to
trace
chapter
the
tragedy
of
birlstone
now
for
a
moment
i
will
ask
leave
to
remove
my
own
insignificant
personality
and
to
describe
events
which
occurred
before
we
arrived
upon
the
scene
by
the
light
of
knowledge
which
came
to
us
afterwards
only
in
this
way
can
i
make
the
reader
appreciate
the
people
concerned
and
the
strange
setting
in
which
their
fate
was
cast
the
village
of
birlstone
is
a
small
and
very
ancient
cluster
of
half
timbered
cottages
on
the
northern
border
of
the
county
of
sussex
for
centuries
it
had
remained
unchanged
but
within
the
last
few
years
its
picturesque
appearance
and
situation
have
attracted
a
number
of
well
to
do
residents
whose
villas
peep
out
from
the
woods
around
these
woods
are
locally
supposed
to
be
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
great
weald
forest
which
thins
away
until
it
reaches
the
northern
chalk
downs
a
number
of
small
shops
have
come
into
being
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
increased
population
so
there
seems
some
prospect
that
birlstone
may
soon
grow
from
an
ancient
village
into
a
modern
town
it
is
the
centre
for
a
considerable
area
of
country
since
tunbridge
wells
the
nearest
place
of
importance
is
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
the
eastward
over
the
borders
of
kent
about
half
a
mile
from
the
town
standing
in
an
old
park
famous
for
its
huge
beech
trees
is
the
ancient
manor
house
of
birlstone
part
of
this
venerable
building
dates
back
to
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
when
hugo
de
capus
built
a
fortalice
in
the
centre
of
the
estate
which
had
been
granted
to
him
by
the
red
king
this
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
and
some
of
its
smoke
blackened
corner
stones
were
used
when
in
jacobean
times
a
brick
country
house
rose
upon
the
ruins
of
the
feudal
castle
the
manor
house
with
its
many
gables
and
its
small
diamond
paned
windows
was
still
much
as
the
builder
had
left
it
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
of
the
double
moats
which
had
guarded
its
more
warlike
predecessor
the
outer
had
been
allowed
to
dry
up
and
served
the
humble
function
of
a
kitchen
garden
the
inner
one
was
still
there
and
lay
forty
feet
in
breadth
though
now
only
a
few
feet
in
depth
round
the
whole
house
a
small
stream
fed
it
and
continued
beyond
it
so
that
the
sheet
of
water
though
turbid
was
never
ditchlike
or
unhealthy
the
ground
floor
windows
were
within
a
foot
of
the
surface
of
the
water
the
only
approach
to
the
house
was
over
a
drawbridge
the
chains
and
windlass
of
which
had
long
been
rusted
and
broken
the
latest
tenants
of
the
manor
house
had
however
with
characteristic
energy
set
this
right
and
the
drawbridge
was
not
only
capable
of
being
raised
but
actually
was
raised
every
evening
and
lowered
every
morning
by
thus
renewing
the
custom
of
the
old
feudal
days
the
manor
house
was
converted
into
an
island
during
the
night
a
fact
which
had
a
very
direct
bearing
upon
the
mystery
which
was
soon
to
engage
the
attention
of
all
england
the
house
had
been
untenanted
for
some
years
and
was
threatening
to
moulder
into
a
picturesque
decay
when
the
douglases
took
possession
of
it
this
family
consisted
of
only
two
individuals
john
douglas
and
his
wife
douglas
was
a
remarkable
man
both
in
character
and
in
person
in
age
he
may
have
been
about
fifty
with
a
strong
jawed
rugged
face
a
grizzling
moustache
peculiarly
keen
gray
eyes
and
a
wiry
vigorous
figure
which
had
lost
nothing
of
the
strength
and
activity
of
youth
he
was
cheery
and
genial
to
all
but
somewhat
offhand
in
his
manners
giving
the
impression
that
he
had
seen
life
in
social
strata
on
some
far
lower
horizon
than
the
county
society
of
sussex
yet
though
looked
at
with
some
curiosity
and
reserve
by
his
more
cultivated
neighbours
he
soon
acquired
a
great
popularity
among
the
villagers
subscribing
handsomely
to
all
local
objects
and
attending
their
smoking
concerts
and
other
functions
where
having
a
remarkably
rich
tenor
voice
he
was
always
ready
to
oblige
with
an
excellent
song
he
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
which
was
said
to
have
been
gained
in
the
california
gold
fields
and
it
was
clear
from
his
own
talk
and
that
of
his
wife
that
he
had
spent
a
part
of
his
life
in
america
the
good
impression
which
had
been
produced
by
his
generosity
and
by
his
democratic
manners
was
increased
by
a
reputation
gained
for
utter
indifference
to
danger
though
a
wretched
rider
he
turned
out
at
every
meet
and
took
the
most
amazing
falls
in
his
determination
to
hold
his
own
with
the
best
when
the
vicarage
caught
fire
he
distinguished
himself
also
by
the
fearlessness
with
which
he
reentered
the
building
to
save
property
after
the
local
fire
brigade
had
given
it
up
as
impossible
thus
it
came
about
that
john
douglas
of
the
manor
house
had
within
five
years
won
himself
quite
a
reputation
in
birlstone
his
wife
too
was
popular
with
those
who
had
made
her
acquaintance
though
after
the
english
fashion
the
callers
upon
a
stranger
who
settled
in
the
county
without
introductions
were
few
and
far
between
this
mattered
the
less
to
her
as
she
was
retiring
by
disposition
and
very
much
absorbed
to
all
appearance
in
her
husband
and
her
domestic
duties
it
was
known
that
she
was
an
english
lady
who
had
met
mr
douglas
in
london
he
being
at
that
time
a
widower
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
tall
dark
and
slender
some
twenty
years
younger
than
her
husband
a
disparity
which
seemed
in
no
wise
to
mar
the
contentment
of
their
family
life
it
was
remarked
sometimes
however
by
those
who
knew
them
best
that
the
confidence
between
the
two
did
not
appear
to
be
complete
since
the
wife
was
either
very
reticent
about
her
husband
s
past
life
or
else
as
seemed
more
likely
was
imperfectly
informed
about
it
it
had
also
been
noted
and
commented
upon
by
a
few
observant
people
that
there
were
signs
sometimes
of
some
nerve
strain
upon
the
part
of
mrs
douglas
and
that
she
would
display
acute
uneasiness
if
her
absent
husband
should
ever
be
particularly
late
in
his
return
on
a
quiet
countryside
where
all
gossip
is
welcome
this
weakness
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
house
did
not
pass
without
remark
and
it
bulked
larger
upon
people
s
memory
when
the
events
arose
which
gave
it
a
very
special
significance
there
was
yet
another
individual
whose
residence
under
that
roof
was
it
is
true
only
an
intermittent
one
but
whose
presence
at
the
time
of
the
strange
happenings
which
will
now
be
narrated
brought
his
name
prominently
before
the
public
this
was
cecil
james
barker
of
hales
lodge
hampstead
cecil
barker
s
tall
loose
jointed
figure
was
a
familiar
one
in
the
main
street
of
birlstone
village
for
he
was
a
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
at
the
manor
house
he
was
the
more
noticed
as
being
the
only
friend
of
the
past
unknown
life
of
mr
douglas
who
was
ever
seen
in
his
new
english
surroundings
barker
was
himself
an
undoubted
englishman
but
by
his
remarks
it
was
clear
that
he
had
first
known
douglas
in
america
and
had
there
lived
on
intimate
terms
with
him
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
considerable
wealth
and
was
reputed
to
be
a
bachelor
in
age
he
was
rather
younger
than
douglas
forty
five
at
the
most
a
tall
straight
broad
chested
fellow
with
a
clean
shaved
prize
fighter
face
thick
strong
black
eyebrows
and
a
pair
of
masterful
black
eyes
which
might
even
without
the
aid
of
his
very
capable
hands
clear
a
way
for
him
through
a
hostile
crowd
he
neither
rode
nor
shot
but
spent
his
days
in
wandering
round
the
old
village
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
or
in
driving
with
his
host
or
in
his
absence
with
his
hostess
over
the
beautiful
countryside
an
easy
going
free
handed
gentleman
said
ames
the
butler
but
my
word
i
had
rather
not
be
the
man
that
crossed
him
he
was
cordial
and
intimate
with
douglas
and
he
was
no
less
friendly
with
his
wife
a
friendship
which
more
than
once
seemed
to
cause
some
irritation
to
the
husband
so
that
even
the
servants
were
able
to
perceive
his
annoyance
such
was
the
third
person
who
was
one
of
the
family
when
the
catastrophe
occurred
as
to
the
other
denizens
of
the
old
building
it
will
suffice
out
of
a
large
household
to
mention
the
prim
respectable
and
capable
ames
and
mrs
allen
a
buxom
and
cheerful
person
who
relieved
the
lady
of
some
of
her
household
cares
the
other
six
servants
in
the
house
bear
no
relation
to
the
events
of
the
night
of
january
th
it
was
at
eleven
forty
five
that
the
first
alarm
reached
the
small
local
police
station
in
charge
of
sergeant
wilson
of
the
sussex
constabulary
cecil
barker
much
excited
had
rushed
up
to
the
door
and
pealed
furiously
upon
the
bell
a
terrible
tragedy
had
occurred
at
the
manor
house
and
john
douglas
had
been
murdered
that
was
the
breathless
burden
of
his
message
he
had
hurried
back
to
the
house
followed
within
a
few
minutes
by
the
police
sergeant
who
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
a
little
after
twelve
o
clock
after
taking
prompt
steps
to
warn
the
county
authorities
that
something
serious
was
afoot
on
reaching
the
manor
house
the
sergeant
had
found
the
drawbridge
down
the
windows
lighted
up
and
the
whole
household
in
a
state
of
wild
confusion
and
alarm
the
white
faced
servants
were
huddling
together
in
the
hall
with
the
frightened
butler
wringing
his
hands
in
the
doorway
only
cecil
barker
seemed
to
be
master
of
himself
and
his
emotions
he
had
opened
the
door
which
was
nearest
to
the
entrance
and
he
had
beckoned
to
the
sergeant
to
follow
him
at
that
moment
there
arrived
dr
wood
a
brisk
and
capable
general
practitioner
from
the
village
the
three
men
entered
the
fatal
room
together
while
the
horror
stricken
butler
followed
at
their
heels
closing
the
door
behind
him
to
shut
out
the
terrible
scene
from
the
maid
servants
the
dead
man
lay
on
his
back
sprawling
with
outstretched
limbs
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
was
clad
only
in
a
pink
dressing
gown
which
covered
his
night
clothes
there
were
carpet
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
the
doctor
knelt
beside
him
and
held
down
the
hand
lamp
which
had
stood
on
the
table
one
glance
at
the
victim
was
enough
to
show
the
healer
that
his
presence
could
be
dispensed
with
the
man
had
been
horribly
injured
lying
across
his
chest
was
a
curious
weapon
a
shotgun
with
the
barrel
sawed
off
a
foot
in
front
of
the
triggers
it
was
clear
that
this
had
been
fired
at
close
range
and
that
he
had
received
the
whole
charge
in
the
face
blowing
his
head
almost
to
pieces
the
triggers
had
been
wired
together
so
as
to
make
the
simultaneous
discharge
more
destructive
the
country
policeman
was
unnerved
and
troubled
by
the
tremendous
responsibility
which
had
come
so
suddenly
upon
him
we
will
touch
nothing
until
my
superiors
arrive
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
staring
in
horror
at
the
dreadful
head
nothing
has
been
touched
up
to
now
said
cecil
barker
i
ll
answer
for
that
you
see
it
all
exactly
as
i
found
it
when
was
that
the
sergeant
had
drawn
out
his
notebook
it
was
just
half
past
eleven
i
had
not
begun
to
undress
and
i
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
my
bedroom
when
i
heard
the
report
it
was
not
very
loud
it
seemed
to
be
muffled
i
rushed
down
i
don
t
suppose
it
was
thirty
seconds
before
i
was
in
the
room
was
the
door
open
yes
it
was
open
poor
douglas
was
lying
as
you
see
him
his
bedroom
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
it
was
i
who
lit
the
lamp
some
minutes
afterward
did
you
see
no
one
no
i
heard
mrs
douglas
coming
down
the
stair
behind
me
and
i
rushed
out
to
prevent
her
from
seeing
this
dreadful
sight
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
came
and
took
her
away
ames
had
arrived
and
we
ran
back
into
the
room
once
more
but
surely
i
have
heard
that
the
drawbridge
is
kept
up
all
night
yes
it
was
up
until
i
lowered
it
then
how
could
any
murderer
have
got
away
it
is
out
of
the
question
mr
douglas
must
have
shot
himself
that
was
our
first
idea
but
see
barker
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
showed
that
the
long
diamond
paned
window
was
open
to
its
full
extent
and
look
at
this
he
held
the
lamp
down
and
illuminated
a
smudge
of
blood
like
the
mark
of
a
boot
sole
upon
the
wooden
sill
someone
has
stood
there
in
getting
out
you
mean
that
someone
waded
across
the
moat
exactly
then
if
you
were
in
the
room
within
half
a
minute
of
the
crime
he
must
have
been
in
the
water
at
that
very
moment
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
wish
to
heaven
that
i
had
rushed
to
the
window
but
the
curtain
screened
it
as
you
can
see
and
so
it
never
occurred
to
me
then
i
heard
the
step
of
mrs
douglas
and
i
could
not
let
her
enter
the
room
it
would
have
been
too
horrible
horrible
enough
said
the
doctor
looking
at
the
shattered
head
and
the
terrible
marks
which
surrounded
it
i
ve
never
seen
such
injuries
since
the
birlstone
railway
smash
but
i
say
remarked
the
police
sergeant
whose
slow
bucolic
common
sense
was
still
pondering
the
open
window
it
s
all
very
well
your
saying
that
a
man
escaped
by
wading
this
moat
but
what
i
ask
you
is
how
did
he
ever
get
into
the
house
at
all
if
the
bridge
was
up
ah
that
s
the
question
said
barker
at
what
o
clock
was
it
raised
it
was
nearly
six
o
clock
said
ames
the
butler
i
ve
heard
said
the
sergeant
that
it
was
usually
raised
at
sunset
that
would
be
nearer
half
past
four
than
six
at
this
time
of
year
mrs
douglas
had
visitors
to
tea
said
ames
i
couldn
t
raise
it
until
they
went
then
i
wound
it
up
myself
then
it
comes
to
this
said
the
sergeant
if
anyone
came
from
outside
if
they
did
they
must
have
got
in
across
the
bridge
before
six
and
been
in
hiding
ever
since
until
mr
douglas
came
into
the
room
after
eleven
that
is
so
mr
douglas
went
round
the
house
every
night
the
last
thing
before
he
turned
in
to
see
that
the
lights
were
right
that
brought
him
in
here
the
man
was
waiting
and
shot
him
then
he
got
away
through
the
window
and
left
his
gun
behind
him
that
s
how
i
read
it
for
nothing
else
will
fit
the
facts
the
sergeant
picked
up
a
card
which
lay
beside
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
the
initials
v
v
and
under
them
the
number
were
rudely
scrawled
in
ink
upon
it
what
s
this
he
asked
holding
it
up
barker
looked
at
it
with
curiosity
i
never
noticed
it
before
he
said
the
murderer
must
have
left
it
behind
him
v
v
i
can
make
no
sense
of
that
the
sergeant
kept
turning
it
over
in
his
big
fingers
what
s
v
v
somebody
s
initials
maybe
what
have
you
got
there
dr
wood
it
was
a
good
sized
hammer
which
had
been
lying
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
a
substantial
workmanlike
hammer
cecil
barker
pointed
to
a
box
of
brass
headed
nails
upon
the
mantelpiece
mr
douglas
was
altering
the
pictures
yesterday
he
said
i
saw
him
myself
standing
upon
that
chair
and
fixing
the
big
picture
above
it
that
accounts
for
the
hammer
we
d
best
put
it
back
on
the
rug
where
we
found
it
said
the
sergeant
scratching
his
puzzled
head
in
his
perplexity
it
will
want
the
best
brains
in
the
force
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
it
will
be
a
london
job
before
it
is
finished
he
raised
the
hand
lamp
and
walked
slowly
round
the
room
hullo
he
cried
excitedly
drawing
the
window
curtain
to
one
side
what
o
clock
were
those
curtains
drawn
when
the
lamps
were
lit
said
the
butler
it
would
be
shortly
after
four
someone
had
been
hiding
here
sure
enough
he
held
down
the
light
and
the
marks
of
muddy
boots
were
very
visible
in
the
corner
i
m
bound
to
say
this
bears
out
your
theory
mr
barker
it
looks
as
if
the
man
got
into
the
house
after
four
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
before
six
when
the
bridge
was
raised
he
slipped
into
this
room
because
it
was
the
first
that
he
saw
there
was
no
other
place
where
he
could
hide
so
he
popped
in
behind
this
curtain
that
all
seems
clear
enough
it
is
likely
that
his
main
idea
was
to
burgle
the
house
but
mr
douglas
chanced
to
come
upon
him
so
he
murdered
him
and
escaped
that
s
how
i
read
it
said
barker
but
i
say
aren
t
we
wasting
precious
time
couldn
t
we
start
out
and
scout
the
country
before
the
fellow
gets
away
the
sergeant
considered
for
a
moment
there
are
no
trains
before
six
in
the
morning
so
he
can
t
get
away
by
rail
if
he
goes
by
road
with
his
legs
all
dripping
it
s
odds
that
someone
will
notice
him
anyhow
i
can
t
leave
here
myself
until
i
am
relieved
but
i
think
none
of
you
should
go
until
we
see
more
clearly
how
we
all
stand
the
doctor
had
taken
the
lamp
and
was
narrowly
scrutinizing
the
body
what
s
this
mark
he
asked
could
this
have
any
connection
with
the
crime
the
dead
man
s
right
arm
was
thrust
out
from
his
dressing
gown
and
exposed
as
high
as
the
elbow
about
halfway
up
the
forearm
was
a
curious
brown
design
a
triangle
inside
a
circle
standing
out
in
vivid
relief
upon
the
lard
coloured
skin
it
s
not
tattooed
said
the
doctor
peering
through
his
glasses
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
the
man
has
been
branded
at
some
time
as
they
brand
cattle
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
don
t
profess
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
said
cecil
barker
but
i
have
seen
the
mark
on
douglas
many
times
this
last
ten
years
and
so
have
i
said
the
butler
many
a
time
when
the
master
has
rolled
up
his
sleeves
i
have
noticed
that
very
mark
i
ve
often
wondered
what
it
could
be
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
anyhow
said
the
sergeant
but
it
s
a
rum
thing
all
the
same
everything
about
this
case
is
rum
well
what
is
it
now
the
butler
had
given
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
was
pointing
at
the
dead
man
s
outstretched
hand
they
ve
taken
his
wedding
ring
he
gasped
what
yes
indeed
master
always
wore
his
plain
gold
wedding
ring
on
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
that
ring
with
the
rough
nugget
on
it
was
above
it
and
the
twisted
snake
ring
on
the
third
finger
there
s
the
nugget
and
there
s
the
snake
but
the
wedding
ring
is
gone
he
s
right
said
barker
do
you
tell
me
said
the
sergeant
that
the
wedding
ring
was
below
the
other
always
then
the
murderer
or
whoever
it
was
first
took
off
this
ring
you
call
the
nugget
ring
then
the
wedding
ring
and
afterwards
put
the
nugget
ring
back
again
that
is
so
the
worthy
country
policeman
shook
his
head
seems
to
me
the
sooner
we
get
london
on
to
this
case
the
better
said
he
white
mason
is
a
smart
man
no
local
job
has
ever
been
too
much
for
white
mason
it
won
t
be
long
now
before
he
is
here
to
help
us
but
i
expect
we
ll
have
to
look
to
london
before
we
are
through
anyhow
i
m
not
ashamed
to
say
that
it
is
a
deal
too
thick
for
the
likes
of
me
chapter
darkness
at
three
in
the
morning
the
chief
sussex
detective
obeying
the
urgent
call
from
sergeant
wilson
of
birlstone
arrived
from
headquarters
in
a
light
dog
cart
behind
a
breathless
trotter
by
the
five
forty
train
in
the
morning
he
had
sent
his
message
to
scotland
yard
and
he
was
at
the
birlstone
station
at
twelve
o
clock
to
welcome
us
white
mason
was
a
quiet
comfortable
looking
person
in
a
loose
tweed
suit
with
a
clean
shaved
ruddy
face
a
stoutish
body
and
powerful
bandy
legs
adorned
with
gaiters
looking
like
a
small
farmer
a
retired
gamekeeper
or
anything
upon
earth
except
a
very
favourable
specimen
of
the
provincial
criminal
officer
a
real
downright
snorter
mr
macdonald
he
kept
repeating
we
ll
have
the
pressmen
down
like
flies
when
they
understand
it
i
m
hoping
we
will
get
our
work
done
before
they
get
poking
their
noses
into
it
and
messing
up
all
the
trails
there
has
been
nothing
like
this
that
i
can
remember
there
are
some
bits
that
will
come
home
to
you
mr
holmes
or
i
am
mistaken
and
you
also
dr
watson
for
the
medicos
will
have
a
word
to
say
before
we
finish
your
room
is
at
the
westville
arms
there
s
no
other
place
but
i
hear
that
it
is
clean
and
good
the
man
will
carry
your
bags
this
way
gentlemen
if
you
please
he
was
a
very
bustling
and
genial
person
this
sussex
detective
in
ten
minutes
we
had
all
found
our
quarters
in
ten
more
we
were
seated
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
and
being
treated
to
a
rapid
sketch
of
those
events
which
have
been
outlined
in
the
previous
chapter
macdonald
made
an
occasional
note
while
holmes
sat
absorbed
with
the
expression
of
surprised
and
reverent
admiration
with
which
the
botanist
surveys
the
rare
and
precious
bloom
remarkable
he
said
when
the
story
was
unfolded
most
remarkable
i
can
hardly
recall
any
case
where
the
features
have
been
more
peculiar
i
thought
you
would
say
so
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
in
great
delight
we
re
well
up
with
the
times
in
sussex
i
ve
told
you
now
how
matters
were
up
to
the
time
when
i
took
over
from
sergeant
wilson
between
three
and
four
this
morning
my
word
i
made
the
old
mare
go
but
i
need
not
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
as
it
turned
out
for
there
was
nothing
immediate
that
i
could
do
sergeant
wilson
had
all
the
facts
i
checked
them
and
considered
them
and
maybe
added
a
few
of
my
own
what
were
they
asked
holmes
eagerly
well
i
first
had
the
hammer
examined
there
was
dr
wood
there
to
help
me
we
found
no
signs
of
violence
upon
it
i
was
hoping
that
if
mr
douglas
defended
himself
with
the
hammer
he
might
have
left
his
mark
upon
the
murderer
before
he
dropped
it
on
the
mat
but
there
was
no
stain
that
of
course
proves
nothing
at
all
remarked
inspector
macdonald
there
has
been
many
a
hammer
murder
and
no
trace
on
the
hammer
quite
so
it
doesn
t
prove
it
wasn
t
used
but
there
might
have
been
stains
and
that
would
have
helped
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
none
then
i
examined
the
gun
they
were
buckshot
cartridges
and
as
sergeant
wilson
pointed
out
the
triggers
were
wired
together
so
that
if
you
pulled
on
the
hinder
one
both
barrels
were
discharged
whoever
fixed
that
up
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
take
no
chances
of
missing
his
man
the
sawed
gun
was
not
more
than
two
foot
long
one
could
carry
it
easily
under
one
s
coat
there
was
no
complete
maker
s
name
but
the
printed
letters
p
e
n
were
on
the
fluting
between
the
barrels
and
the
rest
of
the
name
had
been
cut
off
by
the
saw
a
big
p
with
a
flourish
above
it
e
and
n
smaller
asked
holmes
exactly
pennsylvania
small
arms
company
well
known
american
firm
said
holmes
white
mason
gazed
at
my
friend
as
the
little
village
practitioner
looks
at
the
harley
street
specialist
who
by
a
word
can
solve
the
difficulties
that
perplex
him
that
is
very
helpful
mr
holmes
no
doubt
you
are
right
wonderful
wonderful
do
you
carry
the
names
of
all
the
gun
makers
in
the
world
in
your
memory
holmes
dismissed
the
subject
with
a
wave
no
doubt
it
is
an
american
shotgun
white
mason
continued
i
seem
to
have
read
that
a
sawed
off
shotgun
is
a
weapon
used
in
some
parts
of
america
apart
from
the
name
upon
the
barrel
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
there
is
some
evidence
then
that
this
man
who
entered
the
house
and
killed
its
master
was
an
american
macdonald
shook
his
head
man
you
are
surely
travelling
overfast
said
he
i
have
heard
no
evidence
yet
that
any
stranger
was
ever
in
the
house
at
all
the
open
window
the
blood
on
the
sill
the
queer
card
the
marks
of
boots
in
the
corner
the
gun
nothing
there
that
could
not
have
been
arranged
mr
douglas
was
an
american
or
had
lived
long
in
america
so
had
mr
barker
you
don
t
need
to
import
an
american
from
outside
in
order
to
account
for
american
doings
ames
the
butler
what
about
him
is
he
reliable
ten
years
with
sir
charles
chandos
as
solid
as
a
rock
he
has
been
with
douglas
ever
since
he
took
the
manor
house
five
years
ago
he
has
never
seen
a
gun
of
this
sort
in
the
house
the
gun
was
made
to
conceal
that
s
why
the
barrels
were
sawed
it
would
fit
into
any
box
how
could
he
swear
there
was
no
such
gun
in
the
house
well
anyhow
he
had
never
seen
one
macdonald
shook
his
obstinate
scotch
head
i
m
not
convinced
yet
that
there
was
ever
anyone
in
the
house
said
he
i
m
asking
you
to
conseedar
his
accent
became
more
aberdonian
as
he
lost
himself
in
his
argument
i
m
asking
you
to
conseedar
what
it
involves
if
you
suppose
that
this
gun
was
ever
brought
into
the
house
and
that
all
these
strange
things
were
done
by
a
person
from
outside
oh
man
it
s
just
inconceivable
it
s
clean
against
common
sense
i
put
it
to
you
mr
holmes
judging
it
by
what
we
have
heard
well
state
your
case
mr
mac
said
holmes
in
his
most
judicial
style
the
man
is
not
a
burglar
supposing
that
he
ever
existed
the
ring
business
and
the
card
point
to
premeditated
murder
for
some
private
reason
very
good
here
is
a
man
who
slips
into
a
house
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
committing
murder
he
knows
if
he
knows
anything
that
he
will
have
a
deeficulty
in
making
his
escape
as
the
house
is
surrounded
with
water
what
weapon
would
he
choose
you
would
say
the
most
silent
in
the
world
then
he
could
hope
when
the
deed
was
done
to
slip
quickly
from
the
window
to
wade
the
moat
and
to
get
away
at
his
leisure
that
s
understandable
but
is
it
understandable
that
he
should
go
out
of
his
way
to
bring
with
him
the
most
noisy
weapon
he
could
select
knowing
well
that
it
will
fetch
every
human
being
in
the
house
to
the
spot
as
quick
as
they
can
run
and
that
it
is
all
odds
that
he
will
be
seen
before
he
can
get
across
the
moat
is
that
credible
mr
holmes
well
you
put
the
case
strongly
my
friend
replied
thoughtfully
it
certainly
needs
a
good
deal
of
justification
may
i
ask
mr
white
mason
whether
you
examined
the
farther
side
of
the
moat
at
once
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
man
having
climbed
out
from
the
water
there
were
no
signs
mr
holmes
but
it
is
a
stone
ledge
and
one
could
hardly
expect
them
no
tracks
or
marks
none
ha
would
there
be
any
objection
mr
white
mason
to
our
going
down
to
the
house
at
once
there
may
possibly
be
some
small
point
which
might
be
suggestive
i
was
going
to
propose
it
mr
holmes
but
i
thought
it
well
to
put
you
in
touch
with
all
the
facts
before
we
go
i
suppose
if
anything
should
strike
you
white
mason
looked
doubtfully
at
the
amateur
i
have
worked
with
mr
holmes
before
said
inspector
macdonald
he
plays
the
game
my
own
idea
of
the
game
at
any
rate
said
holmes
with
a
smile
i
go
into
a
case
to
help
the
ends
of
justice
and
the
work
of
the
police
if
i
have
ever
separated
myself
from
the
official
force
it
is
because
they
have
first
separated
themselves
from
me
i
have
no
wish
ever
to
score
at
their
expense
at
the
same
time
mr
white
mason
i
claim
the
right
to
work
in
my
own
way
and
give
my
results
at
my
own
time
complete
rather
than
in
stages
i
am
sure
we
are
honoured
by
your
presence
and
to
show
you
all
we
know
said
white
mason
cordially
come
along
dr
watson
and
when
the
time
comes
we
ll
all
hope
for
a
place
in
your
book
we
walked
down
the
quaint
village
street
with
a
row
of
pollarded
elms
on
each
side
of
it
just
beyond
were
two
ancient
stone
pillars
weather
stained
and
lichen
blotched
bearing
upon
their
summits
a
shapeless
something
which
had
once
been
the
rampant
lion
of
capus
of
birlstone
a
short
walk
along
the
winding
drive
with
such
sward
and
oaks
around
it
as
one
only
sees
in
rural
england
then
a
sudden
turn
and
the
long
low
jacobean
house
of
dingy
liver
coloured
brick
lay
before
us
with
an
old
fashioned
garden
of
cut
yews
on
each
side
of
it
as
we
approached
it
there
was
the
wooden
drawbridge
and
the
beautiful
broad
moat
as
still
and
luminous
as
quicksilver
in
the
cold
winter
sunshine
three
centuries
had
flowed
past
the
old
manor
house
centuries
of
births
and
of
homecomings
of
country
dances
and
of
the
meetings
of
fox
hunters
strange
that
now
in
its
old
age
this
dark
business
should
have
cast
its
shadow
upon
the
venerable
walls
and
yet
those
strange
peaked
roofs
and
quaint
overhung
gables
were
a
fitting
covering
to
grim
and
terrible
intrigue
as
i
looked
at
the
deep
set
windows
and
the
long
sweep
of
the
dull
coloured
water
lapped
front
i
felt
that
no
more
fitting
scene
could
be
set
for
such
a
tragedy
that
s
the
window
said
white
mason
that
one
on
the
immediate
right
of
the
drawbridge
it
s
open
just
as
it
was
found
last
night
it
looks
rather
narrow
for
a
man
to
pass
well
it
wasn
t
a
fat
man
anyhow
we
don
t
need
your
deductions
mr
holmes
to
tell
us
that
but
you
or
i
could
squeeze
through
all
right
holmes
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
and
looked
across
then
he
examined
the
stone
ledge
and
the
grass
border
beyond
it
i
ve
had
a
good
look
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
there
is
nothing
there
no
sign
that
anyone
has
landed
but
why
should
he
leave
any
sign
exactly
why
should
he
is
the
water
always
turbid
generally
about
this
colour
the
stream
brings
down
the
clay
how
deep
is
it
about
two
feet
at
each
side
and
three
in
the
middle
so
we
can
put
aside
all
idea
of
the
man
having
been
drowned
in
crossing
no
a
child
could
not
be
drowned
in
it
we
walked
across
the
drawbridge
and
were
admitted
by
a
quaint
gnarled
dried
up
person
who
was
the
butler
ames
the
poor
old
fellow
was
white
and
quivering
from
the
shock
the
village
sergeant
a
tall
formal
melancholy
man
still
held
his
vigil
in
the
room
of
fate
the
doctor
had
departed
anything
fresh
sergeant
wilson
asked
white
mason
no
sir
then
you
can
go
home
you
ve
had
enough
we
can
send
for
you
if
we
want
you
the
butler
had
better
wait
outside
tell
him
to
warn
mr
cecil
barker
mrs
douglas
and
the
housekeeper
that
we
may
want
a
word
with
them
presently
now
gentlemen
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
give
you
the
views
i
have
formed
first
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
arrive
at
your
own
he
impressed
me
this
country
specialist
he
had
a
solid
grip
of
fact
and
a
cool
clear
common
sense
brain
which
should
take
him
some
way
in
his
profession
holmes
listened
to
him
intently
with
no
sign
of
that
impatience
which
the
official
exponent
too
often
produced
is
it
suicide
or
is
it
murder
that
s
our
first
question
gentlemen
is
it
not
if
it
were
suicide
then
we
have
to
believe
that
this
man
began
by
taking
off
his
wedding
ring
and
concealing
it
that
he
then
came
down
here
in
his
dressing
gown
trampled
mud
into
a
corner
behind
the
curtain
in
order
to
give
the
idea
someone
had
waited
for
him
opened
the
window
put
blood
on
the
we
can
surely
dismiss
that
said
macdonald
so
i
think
suicide
is
out
of
the
question
then
a
murder
has
been
done
what
we
have
to
determine
is
whether
it
was
done
by
someone
outside
or
inside
the
house
well
let
s
hear
the
argument
there
are
considerable
difficulties
both
ways
and
yet
one
or
the
other
it
must
be
we
will
suppose
first
that
some
person
or
persons
inside
the
house
did
the
crime
they
got
this
man
down
here
at
a
time
when
everything
was
still
and
yet
no
one
was
asleep
they
then
did
the
deed
with
the
queerest
and
noisiest
weapon
in
the
world
so
as
to
tell
everyone
what
had
happened
a
weapon
that
was
never
seen
in
the
house
before
that
does
not
seem
a
very
likely
start
does
it
no
it
does
not
well
then
everyone
is
agreed
that
after
the
alarm
was
given
only
a
minute
at
the
most
had
passed
before
the
whole
household
not
mr
cecil
barker
alone
though
he
claims
to
have
been
the
first
but
ames
and
all
of
them
were
on
the
spot
do
you
tell
me
that
in
that
time
the
guilty
person
managed
to
make
footmarks
in
the
corner
open
the
window
mark
the
sill
with
blood
take
the
wedding
ring
off
the
dead
man
s
finger
and
all
the
rest
of
it
it
s
impossible
you
put
it
very
clearly
said
holmes
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
well
then
we
are
driven
back
to
the
theory
that
it
was
done
by
someone
from
outside
we
are
still
faced
with
some
big
difficulties
but
anyhow
they
have
ceased
to
be
impossibilities
the
man
got
into
the
house
between
four
thirty
and
six
that
is
to
say
between
dusk
and
the
time
when
the
bridge
was
raised
there
had
been
some
visitors
and
the
door
was
open
so
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
he
may
have
been
a
common
burglar
or
he
may
have
had
some
private
grudge
against
mr
douglas
since
mr
douglas
has
spent
most
of
his
life
in
america
and
this
shotgun
seems
to
be
an
american
weapon
it
would
seem
that
the
private
grudge
is
the
more
likely
theory
he
slipped
into
this
room
because
it
was
the
first
he
came
to
and
he
hid
behind
the
curtain
there
he
remained
until
past
eleven
at
night
at
that
time
mr
douglas
entered
the
room
it
was
a
short
interview
if
there
were
any
interview
at
all
for
mrs
douglas
declares
that
her
husband
had
not
left
her
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
she
heard
the
shot
the
candle
shows
that
said
holmes
exactly
the
candle
which
was
a
new
one
is
not
burned
more
than
half
an
inch
he
must
have
placed
it
on
the
table
before
he
was
attacked
otherwise
of
course
it
would
have
fallen
when
he
fell
this
shows
that
he
was
not
attacked
the
instant
that
he
entered
the
room
when
mr
barker
arrived
the
candle
was
lit
and
the
lamp
was
out
that
s
all
clear
enough
well
now
we
can
reconstruct
things
on
those
lines
mr
douglas
enters
the
room
he
puts
down
the
candle
a
man
appears
from
behind
the
curtain
he
is
armed
with
this
gun
he
demands
the
wedding
ring
heaven
only
knows
why
but
so
it
must
have
been
mr
douglas
gave
it
up
then
either
in
cold
blood
or
in
the
course
of
a
struggle
douglas
may
have
gripped
the
hammer
that
was
found
upon
the
mat
he
shot
douglas
in
this
horrible
way
he
dropped
his
gun
and
also
it
would
seem
this
queer
card
v
v
whatever
that
may
mean
and
he
made
his
escape
through
the
window
and
across
the
moat
at
the
very
moment
when
cecil
barker
was
discovering
the
crime
how
s
that
mr
holmes
very
interesting
but
just
a
little
unconvincing
man
it
would
be
absolute
nonsense
if
it
wasn
t
that
anything
else
is
even
worse
cried
macdonald
somebody
killed
the
man
and
whoever
it
was
i
could
clearly
prove
to
you
that
he
should
have
done
it
some
other
way
what
does
he
mean
by
allowing
his
retreat
to
be
cut
off
like
that
what
does
he
mean
by
using
a
shotgun
when
silence
was
his
one
chance
of
escape
come
mr
holmes
it
s
up
to
you
to
give
us
a
lead
since
you
say
mr
white
mason
s
theory
is
unconvincing
holmes
had
sat
intently
observant
during
this
long
discussion
missing
no
word
that
was
said
with
his
keen
eyes
darting
to
right
and
to
left
and
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
speculation
i
should
like
a
few
more
facts
before
i
get
so
far
as
a
theory
mr
mac
said
he
kneeling
down
beside
the
body
dear
me
these
injuries
are
really
appalling
can
we
have
the
butler
in
for
a
moment
ames
i
understand
that
you
have
often
seen
this
very
unusual
mark
a
branded
triangle
inside
a
circle
upon
mr
douglas
s
forearm
frequently
sir
you
never
heard
any
speculation
as
to
what
it
meant
no
sir
it
must
have
caused
great
pain
when
it
was
inflicted
it
is
undoubtedly
a
burn
now
i
observe
ames
that
there
is
a
small
piece
of
plaster
at
the
angle
of
mr
douglas
s
jaw
did
you
observe
that
in
life
yes
sir
he
cut
himself
in
shaving
yesterday
morning
did
you
ever
know
him
to
cut
himself
in
shaving
before
not
for
a
very
long
time
sir
suggestive
said
holmes
it
may
of
course
be
a
mere
coincidence
or
it
may
point
to
some
nervousness
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
reason
to
apprehend
danger
had
you
noticed
anything
unusual
in
his
conduct
yesterday
ames
it
struck
me
that
he
was
a
little
restless
and
excited
sir
ha
the
attack
may
not
have
been
entirely
unexpected
we
do
seem
to
make
a
little
progress
do
we
not
perhaps
you
would
rather
do
the
questioning
mr
mac
no
mr
holmes
it
s
in
better
hands
than
mine
well
then
we
will
pass
to
this
card
v
v
it
is
rough
cardboard
have
you
any
of
the
sort
in
the
house
i
don
t
think
so
holmes
walked
across
to
the
desk
and
dabbed
a
little
ink
from
each
bottle
on
to
the
blotting
paper
it
was
not
printed
in
this
room
he
said
this
is
black
ink
and
the
other
purplish
it
was
done
by
a
thick
pen
and
these
are
fine
no
it
was
done
elsewhere
i
should
say
can
you
make
anything
of
the
inscription
ames
no
sir
nothing
what
do
you
think
mr
mac
it
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
secret
society
of
some
sort
the
same
with
his
badge
upon
the
forearm
that
s
my
idea
too
said
white
mason
well
we
can
adopt
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
and
then
see
how
far
our
difficulties
disappear
an
agent
from
such
a
society
makes
his
way
into
the
house
waits
for
mr
douglas
blows
his
head
nearly
off
with
this
weapon
and
escapes
by
wading
the
moat
after
leaving
a
card
beside
the
dead
man
which
will
when
mentioned
in
the
papers
tell
other
members
of
the
society
that
vengeance
has
been
done
that
all
hangs
together
but
why
this
gun
of
all
weapons
exactly
and
why
the
missing
ring
quite
so
and
why
no
arrest
it
s
past
two
now
i
take
it
for
granted
that
since
dawn
every
constable
within
forty
miles
has
been
looking
out
for
a
wet
stranger
that
is
so
mr
holmes
well
unless
he
has
a
burrow
close
by
or
a
change
of
clothes
ready
they
can
hardly
miss
him
and
yet
they
have
missed
him
up
to
now
holmes
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
examining
with
his
lens
the
blood
mark
on
the
sill
it
is
clearly
the
tread
of
a
shoe
it
is
remarkably
broad
a
splay
foot
one
would
say
curious
because
so
far
as
one
can
trace
any
footmark
in
this
mud
stained
corner
one
would
say
it
was
a
more
shapely
sole
however
they
are
certainly
very
indistinct
what
s
this
under
the
side
table
mr
douglas
s
dumb
bells
said
ames
dumb
bell
there
s
only
one
where
s
the
other
i
don
t
know
mr
holmes
there
may
have
been
only
one
i
have
not
noticed
them
for
months
one
dumb
bell
holmes
said
seriously
but
his
remarks
were
interrupted
by
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
a
tall
sunburned
capable
looking
clean
shaved
man
looked
in
at
us
i
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
that
it
was
the
cecil
barker
of
whom
i
had
heard
his
masterful
eyes
travelled
quickly
with
a
questioning
glance
from
face
to
face
sorry
to
interrupt
your
consultation
said
he
but
you
should
hear
the
latest
news
an
arrest
no
such
luck
but
they
ve
found
his
bicycle
the
fellow
left
his
bicycle
behind
him
come
and
have
a
look
it
is
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
hall
door
we
found
three
or
four
grooms
and
idlers
standing
in
the
drive
inspecting
a
bicycle
which
had
been
drawn
out
from
a
clump
of
evergreens
in
which
it
had
been
concealed
it
was
a
well
used
rudge
whitworth
splashed
as
from
a
considerable
journey
there
was
a
saddlebag
with
spanner
and
oilcan
but
no
clue
as
to
the
owner
it
would
be
a
grand
help
to
the
police
said
the
inspector
if
these
things
were
numbered
and
registered
but
we
must
be
thankful
for
what
we
ve
got
if
we
can
t
find
where
he
went
to
at
least
we
are
likely
to
get
where
he
came
from
but
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
wonderful
made
the
fellow
leave
it
behind
and
how
in
the
world
has
he
got
away
without
it
we
don
t
seem
to
get
a
gleam
of
light
in
the
case
mr
holmes
don
t
we
my
friend
answered
thoughtfully
i
wonder
chapter
the
people
of
the
drama
have
you
seen
all
you
want
of
the
study
asked
white
mason
as
we
reentered
the
house
for
the
time
said
the
inspector
and
holmes
nodded
then
perhaps
you
would
now
like
to
hear
the
evidence
of
some
of
the
people
in
the
house
we
could
use
the
dining
room
ames
please
come
yourself
first
and
tell
us
what
you
know
the
butler
s
account
was
a
simple
and
a
clear
one
and
he
gave
a
convincing
impression
of
sincerity
he
had
been
engaged
five
years
before
when
douglas
first
came
to
birlstone
he
understood
that
mr
douglas
was
a
rich
gentleman
who
had
made
his
money
in
america
he
had
been
a
kind
and
considerate
employer
not
quite
what
ames
was
used
to
perhaps
but
one
can
t
have
everything
he
never
saw
any
signs
of
apprehension
in
mr
douglas
on
the
contrary
he
was
the
most
fearless
man
he
had
ever
known
he
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
pulled
up
every
night
because
it
was
the
ancient
custom
of
the
old
house
and
he
liked
to
keep
the
old
ways
up
mr
douglas
seldom
went
to
london
or
left
the
village
but
on
the
day
before
the
crime
he
had
been
shopping
at
tunbridge
wells
he
ames
had
observed
some
restlessness
and
excitement
on
the
part
of
mr
douglas
that
day
for
he
had
seemed
impatient
and
irritable
which
was
unusual
with
him
he
had
not
gone
to
bed
that
night
but
was
in
the
pantry
at
the
back
of
the
house
putting
away
the
silver
when
he
heard
the
bell
ring
violently
he
heard
no
shot
but
it
was
hardly
possible
he
would
as
the
pantry
and
kitchens
were
at
the
very
back
of
the
house
and
there
were
several
closed
doors
and
a
long
passage
between
the
housekeeper
had
come
out
of
her
room
attracted
by
the
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
they
had
gone
to
the
front
of
the
house
together
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
had
seen
mrs
douglas
coming
down
it
no
she
was
not
hurrying
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
she
was
particularly
agitated
just
as
she
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stair
mr
barker
had
rushed
out
of
the
study
he
had
stopped
mrs
douglas
and
begged
her
to
go
back
for
god
s
sake
go
back
to
your
room
he
cried
poor
jack
is
dead
you
can
do
nothing
for
god
s
sake
go
back
after
some
persuasion
upon
the
stairs
mrs
douglas
had
gone
back
she
did
not
scream
she
made
no
outcry
whatever
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
had
taken
her
upstairs
and
stayed
with
her
in
the
bedroom
ames
and
mr
barker
had
then
returned
to
the
study
where
they
had
found
everything
exactly
as
the
police
had
seen
it
the
candle
was
not
lit
at
that
time
but
the
lamp
was
burning
they
had
looked
out
of
the
window
but
the
night
was
very
dark
and
nothing
could
be
seen
or
heard
they
had
then
rushed
out
into
the
hall
where
ames
had
turned
the
windlass
which
lowered
the
drawbridge
mr
barker
had
then
hurried
off
to
get
the
police
such
in
its
essentials
was
the
evidence
of
the
butler
the
account
of
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
was
so
far
as
it
went
a
corroboration
of
that
of
her
fellow
servant
the
housekeeper
s
room
was
rather
nearer
to
the
front
of
the
house
than
the
pantry
in
which
ames
had
been
working
she
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
when
the
loud
ringing
of
the
bell
had
attracted
her
attention
she
was
a
little
hard
of
hearing
perhaps
that
was
why
she
had
not
heard
the
shot
but
in
any
case
the
study
was
a
long
way
off
she
remembered
hearing
some
sound
which
she
imagined
to
be
the
slamming
of
a
door
that
was
a
good
deal
earlier
half
an
hour
at
least
before
the
ringing
of
the
bell
when
mr
ames
ran
to
the
front
she
went
with
him
she
saw
mr
barker
very
pale
and
excited
come
out
of
the
study
he
intercepted
mrs
douglas
who
was
coming
down
the
stairs
he
entreated
her
to
go
back
and
she
answered
him
but
what
she
said
could
not
be
heard
take
her
up
stay
with
her
he
had
said
to
mrs
allen
she
had
therefore
taken
her
to
the
bedroom
and
endeavoured
to
soothe
her
she
was
greatly
excited
trembling
all
over
but
made
no
other
attempt
to
go
downstairs
she
just
sat
in
her
dressing
gown
by
her
bedroom
fire
with
her
head
sunk
in
her
hands
mrs
allen
stayed
with
her
most
of
the
night
as
to
the
other
servants
they
had
all
gone
to
bed
and
the
alarm
did
not
reach
them
until
just
before
the
police
arrived
they
slept
at
the
extreme
back
of
the
house
and
could
not
possibly
have
heard
anything
so
far
the
housekeeper
could
add
nothing
on
cross
examination
save
lamentations
and
expressions
of
amazement
cecil
barker
succeeded
mrs
allen
as
a
witness
as
to
the
occurrences
of
the
night
before
he
had
very
little
to
add
to
what
he
had
already
told
the
police
personally
he
was
convinced
that
the
murderer
had
escaped
by
the
window
the
bloodstain
was
conclusive
in
his
opinion
on
that
point
besides
as
the
bridge
was
up
there
was
no
other
possible
way
of
escaping
he
could
not
explain
what
had
become
of
the
assassin
or
why
he
had
not
taken
his
bicycle
if
it
were
indeed
his
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
drowned
in
the
moat
which
was
at
no
place
more
than
three
feet
deep
in
his
own
mind
he
had
a
very
definite
theory
about
the
murder
douglas
was
a
reticent
man
and
there
were
some
chapters
in
his
life
of
which
he
never
spoke
he
had
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was
a
very
young
man
he
had
prospered
well
and
barker
had
first
met
him
in
california
where
they
had
become
partners
in
a
successful
mining
claim
at
a
place
called
benito
canyon
they
had
done
very
well
but
douglas
had
suddenly
sold
out
and
started
for
england
he
was
a
widower
at
that
time
barker
had
afterwards
realized
his
money
and
come
to
live
in
london
thus
they
had
renewed
their
friendship
douglas
had
given
him
the
impression
that
some
danger
was
hanging
over
his
head
and
he
had
always
looked
upon
his
sudden
departure
from
california
and
also
his
renting
a
house
in
so
quiet
a
place
in
england
as
being
connected
with
this
peril
he
imagined
that
some
secret
society
some
implacable
organization
was
on
douglas
s
track
which
would
never
rest
until
it
killed
him
some
remarks
of
his
had
given
him
this
idea
though
he
had
never
told
him
what
the
society
was
nor
how
he
had
come
to
offend
it
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
legend
upon
the
placard
had
some
reference
to
this
secret
society
how
long
were
you
with
douglas
in
california
asked
inspector
macdonald
five
years
altogether
he
was
a
bachelor
you
say
a
widower
have
you
ever
heard
where
his
first
wife
came
from
no
i
remember
his
saying
that
she
was
of
german
extraction
and
i
have
seen
her
portrait
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
she
died
of
typhoid
the
year
before
i
met
him
you
don
t
associate
his
past
with
any
particular
part
of
america
i
have
heard
him
talk
of
chicago
he
knew
that
city
well
and
had
worked
there
i
have
heard
him
talk
of
the
coal
and
iron
districts
he
had
travelled
a
good
deal
in
his
time
was
he
a
politician
had
this
secret
society
to
do
with
politics
no
he
cared
nothing
about
politics
you
have
no
reason
to
think
it
was
criminal
on
the
contrary
i
never
met
a
straighter
man
in
my
life
was
there
anything
curious
about
his
life
in
california
he
liked
best
to
stay
and
to
work
at
our
claim
in
the
mountains
he
would
never
go
where
other
men
were
if
he
could
help
it
that
s
why
i
first
thought
that
someone
was
after
him
then
when
he
left
so
suddenly
for
europe
i
made
sure
that
it
was
so
i
believe
that
he
had
a
warning
of
some
sort
within
a
week
of
his
leaving
half
a
dozen
men
were
inquiring
for
him
what
sort
of
men
well
they
were
a
mighty
hard
looking
crowd
they
came
up
to
the
claim
and
wanted
to
know
where
he
was
i
told
them
that
he
was
gone
to
europe
and
that
i
did
not
know
where
to
find
him
they
meant
him
no
good
it
was
easy
to
see
that
were
these
men
americans
californians
well
i
don
t
know
about
californians
they
were
americans
all
right
but
they
were
not
miners
i
don
t
know
what
they
were
and
was
very
glad
to
see
their
backs
that
was
six
years
ago
nearer
seven
and
then
you
were
together
five
years
in
california
so
that
this
business
dates
back
not
less
than
eleven
years
at
the
least
that
is
so
it
must
be
a
very
serious
feud
that
would
be
kept
up
with
such
earnestness
for
as
long
as
that
it
would
be
no
light
thing
that
would
give
rise
to
it
i
think
it
shadowed
his
whole
life
it
was
never
quite
out
of
his
mind
but
if
a
man
had
a
danger
hanging
over
him
and
knew
what
it
was
don
t
you
think
he
would
turn
to
the
police
for
protection
maybe
it
was
some
danger
that
he
could
not
be
protected
against
there
s
one
thing
you
should
know
he
always
went
about
armed
his
revolver
was
never
out
of
his
pocket
but
by
bad
luck
he
was
in
his
dressing
gown
and
had
left
it
in
the
bedroom
last
night
once
the
bridge
was
up
i
guess
he
thought
he
was
safe
i
should
like
these
dates
a
little
clearer
said
macdonald
it
is
quite
six
years
since
douglas
left
california
you
followed
him
next
year
did
you
not
that
is
so
and
he
had
been
married
five
years
you
must
have
returned
about
the
time
of
his
marriage
about
a
month
before
i
was
his
best
man
did
you
know
mrs
douglas
before
her
marriage
no
i
did
not
i
had
been
away
from
england
for
ten
years
but
you
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
since
barker
looked
sternly
at
the
detective
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
since
he
answered
if
i
have
seen
her
it
is
because
you
cannot
visit
a
man
without
knowing
his
wife
if
you
imagine
there
is
any
connection
i
imagine
nothing
mr
barker
i
am
bound
to
make
every
inquiry
which
can
bear
upon
the
case
but
i
mean
no
offense
some
inquiries
are
offensive
barker
answered
angrily
it
s
only
the
facts
that
we
want
it
is
in
your
interest
and
everyone
s
interest
that
they
should
be
cleared
up
did
mr
douglas
entirely
approve
your
friendship
with
his
wife
barker
grew
paler
and
his
great
strong
hands
were
clasped
convulsively
together
you
have
no
right
to
ask
such
questions
he
cried
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
matter
you
are
investigating
i
must
repeat
the
question
well
i
refuse
to
answer
you
can
refuse
to
answer
but
you
must
be
aware
that
your
refusal
is
in
itself
an
answer
for
you
would
not
refuse
if
you
had
not
something
to
conceal
barker
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
face
set
grimly
and
his
strong
black
eyebrows
drawn
low
in
intense
thought
then
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
well
i
guess
you
gentlemen
are
only
doing
your
clear
duty
after
all
and
i
have
no
right
to
stand
in
the
way
of
it
i
d
only
ask
you
not
to
worry
mrs
douglas
over
this
matter
for
she
has
enough
upon
her
just
now
i
may
tell
you
that
poor
douglas
had
just
one
fault
in
the
world
and
that
was
his
jealousy
he
was
fond
of
me
no
man
could
be
fonder
of
a
friend
and
he
was
devoted
to
his
wife
he
loved
me
to
come
here
and
was
forever
sending
for
me
and
yet
if
his
wife
and
i
talked
together
or
there
seemed
any
sympathy
between
us
a
kind
of
wave
of
jealousy
would
pass
over
him
and
he
would
be
off
the
handle
and
saying
the
wildest
things
in
a
moment
more
than
once
i
ve
sworn
off
coming
for
that
reason
and
then
he
would
write
me
such
penitent
imploring
letters
that
i
just
had
to
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
gentlemen
if
it
was
my
last
word
that
no
man
ever
had
a
more
loving
faithful
wife
and
i
can
say
also
no
friend
could
be
more
loyal
than
i
it
was
spoken
with
fervour
and
feeling
and
yet
inspector
macdonald
could
not
dismiss
the
subject
you
are
aware
said
he
that
the
dead
man
s
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
from
his
finger
so
it
appears
said
barker
what
do
you
mean
by
appears
you
know
it
as
a
fact
the
man
seemed
confused
and
undecided
when
i
said
appears
i
meant
that
it
was
conceivable
that
he
had
himself
taken
off
the
ring
the
mere
fact
that
the
ring
should
be
absent
whoever
may
have
removed
it
would
suggest
to
anyone
s
mind
would
it
not
that
the
marriage
and
the
tragedy
were
connected
barker
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
i
can
t
profess
to
say
what
it
means
he
answered
but
if
you
mean
to
hint
that
it
could
reflect
in
any
way
upon
this
lady
s
honour
his
eyes
blazed
for
an
instant
and
then
with
an
evident
effort
he
got
a
grip
upon
his
own
emotions
well
you
are
on
the
wrong
track
that
s
all
i
don
t
know
that
i
ve
anything
else
to
ask
you
at
present
said
macdonald
coldly
there
was
one
small
point
remarked
sherlock
holmes
when
you
entered
the
room
there
was
only
a
candle
lighted
on
the
table
was
there
not
yes
that
was
so
by
its
light
you
saw
that
some
terrible
incident
had
occurred
exactly
you
at
once
rang
for
help
yes
and
it
arrived
very
speedily
within
a
minute
or
so
and
yet
when
they
arrived
they
found
that
the
candle
was
out
and
that
the
lamp
had
been
lighted
that
seems
very
remarkable
again
barker
showed
some
signs
of
indecision
i
don
t
see
that
it
was
remarkable
mr
holmes
he
answered
after
a
pause
the
candle
threw
a
very
bad
light
my
first
thought
was
to
get
a
better
one
the
lamp
was
on
the
table
so
i
lit
it
and
blew
out
the
candle
exactly
holmes
asked
no
further
question
and
barker
with
a
deliberate
look
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
which
had
as
it
seemed
to
me
something
of
defiance
in
it
turned
and
left
the
room
inspector
macdonald
had
sent
up
a
note
to
the
effect
that
he
would
wait
upon
mrs
douglas
in
her
room
but
she
had
replied
that
she
would
meet
us
in
the
dining
room
she
entered
now
a
tall
and
beautiful
woman
of
thirty
reserved
and
self
possessed
to
a
remarkable
degree
very
different
from
the
tragic
and
distracted
figure
i
had
pictured
it
is
true
that
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
like
that
of
one
who
has
endured
a
great
shock
but
her
manner
was
composed
and
the
finely
moulded
hand
which
she
rested
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
was
as
steady
as
my
own
her
sad
appealing
eyes
travelled
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
a
curiously
inquisitive
expression
that
questioning
gaze
transformed
itself
suddenly
into
abrupt
speech
have
you
found
anything
out
yet
she
asked
was
it
my
imagination
that
there
was
an
undertone
of
fear
rather
than
of
hope
in
the
question
we
have
taken
every
possible
step
mrs
douglas
said
the
inspector
you
may
rest
assured
that
nothing
will
be
neglected
spare
no
money
she
said
in
a
dead
even
tone
it
is
my
desire
that
every
possible
effort
should
be
made
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
i
fear
not
but
all
i
know
is
at
your
service
we
have
heard
from
mr
cecil
barker
that
you
did
not
actually
see
that
you
were
never
in
the
room
where
the
tragedy
occurred
no
he
turned
me
back
upon
the
stairs
he
begged
me
to
return
to
my
room
quite
so
you
had
heard
the
shot
and
you
had
at
once
come
down
i
put
on
my
dressing
gown
and
then
came
down
how
long
was
it
after
hearing
the
shot
that
you
were
stopped
on
the
stair
by
mr
barker
it
may
have
been
a
couple
of
minutes
it
is
so
hard
to
reckon
time
at
such
a
moment
he
implored
me
not
to
go
on
he
assured
me
that
i
could
do
nothing
then
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
led
me
upstairs
again
it
was
all
like
some
dreadful
dream
can
you
give
us
any
idea
how
long
your
husband
had
been
downstairs
before
you
heard
the
shot
no
i
cannot
say
he
went
from
his
dressing
room
and
i
did
not
hear
him
go
he
did
the
round
of
the
house
every
night
for
he
was
nervous
of
fire
it
is
the
only
thing
that
i
have
ever
known
him
nervous
of
that
is
just
the
point
which
i
want
to
come
to
mrs
douglas
you
have
known
your
husband
only
in
england
have
you
not
yes
we
have
been
married
five
years
have
you
heard
him
speak
of
anything
which
occurred
in
america
and
might
bring
some
danger
upon
him
mrs
douglas
thought
earnestly
before
she
answered
yes
she
said
at
last
i
have
always
felt
that
there
was
a
danger
hanging
over
him
he
refused
to
discuss
it
with
me
it
was
not
from
want
of
confidence
in
me
there
was
the
most
complete
love
and
confidence
between
us
but
it
was
out
of
his
desire
to
keep
all
alarm
away
from
me
he
thought
i
should
brood
over
it
if
i
knew
all
and
so
he
was
silent
how
did
you
know
it
then
mrs
douglas
s
face
lit
with
a
quick
smile
can
a
husband
ever
carry
about
a
secret
all
his
life
and
a
woman
who
loves
him
have
no
suspicion
of
it
i
knew
it
by
his
refusal
to
talk
about
some
episodes
in
his
american
life
i
knew
it
by
certain
precautions
he
took
i
knew
it
by
certain
words
he
let
fall
i
knew
it
by
the
way
he
looked
at
unexpected
strangers
i
was
perfectly
certain
that
he
had
some
powerful
enemies
that
he
believed
they
were
on
his
track
and
that
he
was
always
on
his
guard
against
them
i
was
so
sure
of
it
that
for
years
i
have
been
terrified
if
ever
he
came
home
later
than
was
expected
might
i
ask
asked
holmes
what
the
words
were
which
attracted
your
attention
the
valley
of
fear
the
lady
answered
that
was
an
expression
he
has
used
when
i
questioned
him
i
have
been
in
the
valley
of
fear
i
am
not
out
of
it
yet
are
we
never
to
get
out
of
the
valley
of
fear
i
have
asked
him
when
i
have
seen
him
more
serious
than
usual
sometimes
i
think
that
we
never
shall
he
has
answered
surely
you
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
the
valley
of
fear
i
did
but
his
face
would
become
very
grave
and
he
would
shake
his
head
it
is
bad
enough
that
one
of
us
should
have
been
in
its
shadow
he
said
please
god
it
shall
never
fall
upon
you
it
was
some
real
valley
in
which
he
had
lived
and
in
which
something
terrible
had
occurred
to
him
of
that
i
am
certain
but
i
can
tell
you
no
more
and
he
never
mentioned
any
names
yes
he
was
delirious
with
fever
once
when
he
had
his
hunting
accident
three
years
ago
then
i
remember
that
there
was
a
name
that
came
continually
to
his
lips
he
spoke
it
with
anger
and
a
sort
of
horror
mcginty
was
the
name
bodymaster
mcginty
i
asked
him
when
he
recovered
who
bodymaster
mcginty
was
and
whose
body
he
was
master
of
never
of
mine
thank
god
he
answered
with
a
laugh
and
that
was
all
i
could
get
from
him
but
there
is
a
connection
between
bodymaster
mcginty
and
the
valley
of
fear
there
is
one
other
point
said
inspector
macdonald
you
met
mr
douglas
in
a
boarding
house
in
london
did
you
not
and
became
engaged
to
him
there
was
there
any
romance
anything
secret
or
mysterious
about
the
wedding
there
was
romance
there
is
always
romance
there
was
nothing
mysterious
he
had
no
rival
no
i
was
quite
free
you
have
heard
no
doubt
that
his
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
does
that
suggest
anything
to
you
suppose
that
some
enemy
of
his
old
life
had
tracked
him
down
and
committed
this
crime
what
possible
reason
could
he
have
for
taking
his
wedding
ring
for
an
instant
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
flickered
over
the
woman
s
lips
i
really
cannot
tell
she
answered
it
is
certainly
a
most
extraordinary
thing
well
we
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
and
we
are
sorry
to
have
put
you
to
this
trouble
at
such
a
time
said
the
inspector
there
are
some
other
points
no
doubt
but
we
can
refer
to
you
as
they
arise
she
rose
and
i
was
again
conscious
of
that
quick
questioning
glance
with
which
she
had
just
surveyed
us
what
impression
has
my
evidence
made
upon
you
the
question
might
as
well
have
been
spoken
then
with
a
bow
she
swept
from
the
room
she
s
a
beautiful
woman
a
very
beautiful
woman
said
macdonald
thoughtfully
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
this
man
barker
has
certainly
been
down
here
a
good
deal
he
is
a
man
who
might
be
attractive
to
a
woman
he
admits
that
the
dead
man
was
jealous
and
maybe
he
knew
best
himself
what
cause
he
had
for
jealousy
then
there
s
that
wedding
ring
you
can
t
get
past
that
the
man
who
tears
a
wedding
ring
off
a
dead
man
s
what
do
you
say
to
it
mr
holmes
my
friend
had
sat
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
now
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
ames
he
said
when
the
butler
entered
where
is
mr
cecil
barker
now
i
ll
see
sir
he
came
back
in
a
moment
to
say
that
barker
was
in
the
garden
can
you
remember
ames
what
mr
barker
had
on
his
feet
last
night
when
you
joined
him
in
the
study
yes
mr
holmes
he
had
a
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
i
brought
him
his
boots
when
he
went
for
the
police
where
are
the
slippers
now
they
are
still
under
the
chair
in
the
hall
very
good
ames
it
is
of
course
important
for
us
to
know
which
tracks
may
be
mr
barker
s
and
which
from
outside
yes
sir
i
may
say
that
i
noticed
that
the
slippers
were
stained
with
blood
so
indeed
were
my
own
that
is
natural
enough
considering
the
condition
of
the
room
very
good
ames
we
will
ring
if
we
want
you
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
in
the
study
holmes
had
brought
with
him
the
carpet
slippers
from
the
hall
as
ames
had
observed
the
soles
of
both
were
dark
with
blood
strange
murmured
holmes
as
he
stood
in
the
light
of
the
window
and
examined
them
minutely
very
strange
indeed
stooping
with
one
of
his
quick
feline
pounces
he
placed
the
slipper
upon
the
blood
mark
on
the
sill
it
exactly
corresponded
he
smiled
in
silence
at
his
colleagues
the
inspector
was
transfigured
with
excitement
his
native
accent
rattled
like
a
stick
upon
railings
man
he
cried
there
s
not
a
doubt
of
it
barker
has
just
marked
the
window
himself
it
s
a
good
deal
broader
than
any
bootmark
i
mind
that
you
said
it
was
a
splay
foot
and
here
s
the
explanation
but
what
s
the
game
mr
holmes
what
s
the
game
ay
what
s
the
game
my
friend
repeated
thoughtfully
white
mason
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
fat
hands
together
in
his
professional
satisfaction
i
said
it
was
a
snorter
he
cried
and
a
real
snorter
it
is
chapter
a
dawning
light
the
three
detectives
had
many
matters
of
detail
into
which
to
inquire
so
i
returned
alone
to
our
modest
quarters
at
the
village
inn
but
before
doing
so
i
took
a
stroll
in
the
curious
old
world
garden
which
flanked
the
house
rows
of
very
ancient
yew
trees
cut
into
strange
designs
girded
it
round
inside
was
a
beautiful
stretch
of
lawn
with
an
old
sundial
in
the
middle
the
whole
effect
so
soothing
and
restful
that
it
was
welcome
to
my
somewhat
jangled
nerves
in
that
deeply
peaceful
atmosphere
one
could
forget
or
remember
only
as
some
fantastic
nightmare
that
darkened
study
with
the
sprawling
bloodstained
figure
on
the
floor
and
yet
as
i
strolled
round
it
and
tried
to
steep
my
soul
in
its
gentle
balm
a
strange
incident
occurred
which
brought
me
back
to
the
tragedy
and
left
a
sinister
impression
in
my
mind
i
have
said
that
a
decoration
of
yew
trees
circled
the
garden
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
house
they
thickened
into
a
continuous
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
this
hedge
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
anyone
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
house
there
was
a
stone
seat
as
i
approached
the
spot
i
was
aware
of
voices
some
remark
in
the
deep
tones
of
a
man
answered
by
a
little
ripple
of
feminine
laughter
an
instant
later
i
had
come
round
the
end
of
the
hedge
and
my
eyes
lit
upon
mrs
douglas
and
the
man
barker
before
they
were
aware
of
my
presence
her
appearance
gave
me
a
shock
in
the
dining
room
she
had
been
demure
and
discreet
now
all
pretense
of
grief
had
passed
away
from
her
her
eyes
shone
with
the
joy
of
living
and
her
face
still
quivered
with
amusement
at
some
remark
of
her
companion
he
sat
forward
his
hands
clasped
and
his
forearms
on
his
knees
with
an
answering
smile
upon
his
bold
handsome
face
in
an
instant
but
it
was
just
one
instant
too
late
they
resumed
their
solemn
masks
as
my
figure
came
into
view
a
hurried
word
or
two
passed
between
them
and
then
barker
rose
and
came
towards
me
excuse
me
sir
said
he
but
am
i
addressing
dr
watson
i
bowed
with
a
coldness
which
showed
i
dare
say
very
plainly
the
impression
which
had
been
produced
upon
my
mind
we
thought
that
it
was
probably
you
as
your
friendship
with
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
so
well
known
would
you
mind
coming
over
and
speaking
to
mrs
douglas
for
one
instant
i
followed
him
with
a
dour
face
very
clearly
i
could
see
in
my
mind
s
eye
that
shattered
figure
on
the
floor
here
within
a
few
hours
of
the
tragedy
were
his
wife
and
his
nearest
friend
laughing
together
behind
a
bush
in
the
garden
which
had
been
his
i
greeted
the
lady
with
reserve
i
had
grieved
with
her
grief
in
the
dining
room
now
i
met
her
appealing
gaze
with
an
unresponsive
eye
i
fear
that
you
think
me
callous
and
hard
hearted
said
she
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
is
no
business
of
mine
said
i
perhaps
some
day
you
will
do
me
justice
if
you
only
realized
there
is
no
need
why
dr
watson
should
realize
said
barker
quickly
as
he
has
himself
said
it
is
no
possible
business
of
his
exactly
said
i
and
so
i
will
beg
leave
to
resume
my
walk
one
moment
dr
watson
cried
the
woman
in
a
pleading
voice
there
is
one
question
which
you
can
answer
with
more
authority
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
and
it
may
make
a
very
great
difference
to
me
you
know
mr
holmes
and
his
relations
with
the
police
better
than
anyone
else
can
supposing
that
a
matter
were
brought
confidentially
to
his
knowledge
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
pass
it
on
to
the
detectives
yes
that
s
it
said
barker
eagerly
is
he
on
his
own
or
is
he
entirely
in
with
them
i
really
don
t
know
that
i
should
be
justified
in
discussing
such
a
point
i
beg
i
implore
that
you
will
dr
watson
i
assure
you
that
you
will
be
helping
us
helping
me
greatly
if
you
will
guide
us
on
that
point
there
was
such
a
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
woman
s
voice
that
for
the
instant
i
forgot
all
about
her
levity
and
was
moved
only
to
do
her
will
mr
holmes
is
an
independent
investigator
i
said
he
is
his
own
master
and
would
act
as
his
own
judgment
directed
at
the
same
time
he
would
naturally
feel
loyalty
towards
the
officials
who
were
working
on
the
same
case
and
he
would
not
conceal
from
them
anything
which
would
help
them
in
bringing
a
criminal
to
justice
beyond
this
i
can
say
nothing
and
i
would
refer
you
to
mr
holmes
himself
if
you
wanted
fuller
information
so
saying
i
raised
my
hat
and
went
upon
my
way
leaving
them
still
seated
behind
that
concealing
hedge
i
looked
back
as
i
rounded
the
far
end
of
it
and
saw
that
they
were
still
talking
very
earnestly
together
and
as
they
were
gazing
after
me
it
was
clear
that
it
was
our
interview
that
was
the
subject
of
their
debate
i
wish
none
of
their
confidences
said
holmes
when
i
reported
to
him
what
had
occurred
he
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
at
the
manor
house
in
consultation
with
his
two
colleagues
and
returned
about
five
with
a
ravenous
appetite
for
a
high
tea
which
i
had
ordered
for
him
no
confidences
watson
for
they
are
mighty
awkward
if
it
comes
to
an
arrest
for
conspiracy
and
murder
you
think
it
will
come
to
that
he
was
in
his
most
cheerful
and
debonair
humour
my
dear
watson
when
i
have
exterminated
that
fourth
egg
i
shall
be
ready
to
put
you
in
touch
with
the
whole
situation
i
don
t
say
that
we
have
fathomed
it
far
from
it
but
when
we
have
traced
the
missing
dumb
bell
the
dumb
bell
dear
me
watson
is
it
possible
that
you
have
not
penetrated
the
fact
that
the
case
hangs
upon
the
missing
dumb
bell
well
well
you
need
not
be
downcast
for
between
ourselves
i
don
t
think
that
either
inspector
mac
or
the
excellent
local
practitioner
has
grasped
the
overwhelming
importance
of
this
incident
one
dumb
bell
watson
consider
an
athlete
with
one
dumb
bell
picture
to
yourself
the
unilateral
development
the
imminent
danger
of
a
spinal
curvature
shocking
watson
shocking
he
sat
with
his
mouth
full
of
toast
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
watching
my
intellectual
entanglement
the
mere
sight
of
his
excellent
appetite
was
an
assurance
of
success
for
i
had
very
clear
recollections
of
days
and
nights
without
a
thought
of
food
when
his
baffled
mind
had
chafed
before
some
problem
while
his
thin
eager
features
became
more
attenuated
with
the
asceticism
of
complete
mental
concentration
finally
he
lit
his
pipe
and
sitting
in
the
inglenook
of
the
old
village
inn
he
talked
slowly
and
at
random
about
his
case
rather
as
one
who
thinks
aloud
than
as
one
who
makes
a
considered
statement
a
lie
watson
a
great
big
thumping
obtrusive
uncompromising
lie
that
s
what
meets
us
on
the
threshold
there
is
our
starting
point
the
whole
story
told
by
barker
is
a
lie
but
barker
s
story
is
corroborated
by
mrs
douglas
therefore
she
is
lying
also
they
are
both
lying
and
in
a
conspiracy
so
now
we
have
the
clear
problem
why
are
they
lying
and
what
is
the
truth
which
they
are
trying
so
hard
to
conceal
let
us
try
watson
you
and
i
if
we
can
get
behind
the
lie
and
reconstruct
the
truth
how
do
i
know
that
they
are
lying
because
it
is
a
clumsy
fabrication
which
simply
could
not
be
true
consider
according
to
the
story
given
to
us
the
assassin
had
less
than
a
minute
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
to
take
that
ring
which
was
under
another
ring
from
the
dead
man
s
finger
to
replace
the
other
ring
a
thing
which
he
would
surely
never
have
done
and
to
put
that
singular
card
beside
his
victim
i
say
that
this
was
obviously
impossible
you
may
argue
but
i
have
too
much
respect
for
your
judgment
watson
to
think
that
you
will
do
so
that
the
ring
may
have
been
taken
before
the
man
was
killed
the
fact
that
the
candle
had
been
lit
only
a
short
time
shows
that
there
had
been
no
lengthy
interview
was
douglas
from
what
we
hear
of
his
fearless
character
a
man
who
would
be
likely
to
give
up
his
wedding
ring
at
such
short
notice
or
could
we
conceive
of
his
giving
it
up
at
all
no
no
watson
the
assassin
was
alone
with
the
dead
man
for
some
time
with
the
lamp
lit
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
but
the
gunshot
was
apparently
the
cause
of
death
therefore
the
shot
must
have
been
fired
some
time
earlier
than
we
are
told
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
such
a
matter
as
that
we
are
in
the
presence
therefore
of
a
deliberate
conspiracy
upon
the
part
of
the
two
people
who
heard
the
gunshot
of
the
man
barker
and
of
the
woman
douglas
when
on
the
top
of
this
i
am
able
to
show
that
the
blood
mark
on
the
windowsill
was
deliberately
placed
there
by
barker
in
order
to
give
a
false
clue
to
the
police
you
will
admit
that
the
case
grows
dark
against
him
now
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
at
what
hour
the
murder
actually
did
occur
up
to
half
past
ten
the
servants
were
moving
about
the
house
so
it
was
certainly
not
before
that
time
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
they
had
all
gone
to
their
rooms
with
the
exception
of
ames
who
was
in
the
pantry
i
have
been
trying
some
experiments
after
you
left
us
this
afternoon
and
i
find
that
no
noise
which
macdonald
can
make
in
the
study
can
penetrate
to
me
in
the
pantry
when
the
doors
are
all
shut
it
is
otherwise
however
from
the
housekeeper
s
room
it
is
not
so
far
down
the
corridor
and
from
it
i
could
vaguely
hear
a
voice
when
it
was
very
loudly
raised
the
sound
from
a
shotgun
is
to
some
extent
muffled
when
the
discharge
is
at
very
close
range
as
it
undoubtedly
was
in
this
instance
it
would
not
be
very
loud
and
yet
in
the
silence
of
the
night
it
should
have
easily
penetrated
to
mrs
allen
s
room
she
is
as
she
has
told
us
somewhat
deaf
but
none
the
less
she
mentioned
in
her
evidence
that
she
did
hear
something
like
a
door
slamming
half
an
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
half
an
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
would
be
a
quarter
to
eleven
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
she
heard
was
the
report
of
the
gun
and
that
this
was
the
real
instant
of
the
murder
if
this
is
so
we
have
now
to
determine
what
barker
and
mrs
douglas
presuming
that
they
are
not
the
actual
murderers
could
have
been
doing
from
quarter
to
eleven
when
the
sound
of
the
shot
brought
them
down
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
they
rang
the
bell
and
summoned
the
servants
what
were
they
doing
and
why
did
they
not
instantly
give
the
alarm
that
is
the
question
which
faces
us
and
when
it
has
been
answered
we
shall
surely
have
gone
some
way
to
solve
our
problem
i
am
convinced
myself
said
i
that
there
is
an
understanding
between
those
two
people
she
must
be
a
heartless
creature
to
sit
laughing
at
some
jest
within
a
few
hours
of
her
husband
s
murder
exactly
she
does
not
shine
as
a
wife
even
in
her
own
account
of
what
occurred
i
am
not
a
whole
souled
admirer
of
womankind
as
you
are
aware
watson
but
my
experience
of
life
has
taught
me
that
there
are
few
wives
having
any
regard
for
their
husbands
who
would
let
any
man
s
spoken
word
stand
between
them
and
that
husband
s
dead
body
should
i
ever
marry
watson
i
should
hope
to
inspire
my
wife
with
some
feeling
which
would
prevent
her
from
being
walked
off
by
a
housekeeper
when
my
corpse
was
lying
within
a
few
yards
of
her
it
was
badly
stage
managed
for
even
the
rawest
investigators
must
be
struck
by
the
absence
of
the
usual
feminine
ululation
if
there
had
been
nothing
else
this
incident
alone
would
have
suggested
a
prearranged
conspiracy
to
my
mind
you
think
then
definitely
that
barker
and
mrs
douglas
are
guilty
of
the
murder
there
is
an
appalling
directness
about
your
questions
watson
said
holmes
shaking
his
pipe
at
me
they
come
at
me
like
bullets
if
you
put
it
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
know
the
truth
about
the
murder
and
are
conspiring
to
conceal
it
then
i
can
give
you
a
whole
souled
answer
i
am
sure
they
do
but
your
more
deadly
proposition
is
not
so
clear
let
us
for
a
moment
consider
the
difficulties
which
stand
in
the
way
we
will
suppose
that
this
couple
are
united
by
the
bonds
of
a
guilty
love
and
that
they
have
determined
to
get
rid
of
the
man
who
stands
between
them
it
is
a
large
supposition
for
discreet
inquiry
among
servants
and
others
has
failed
to
corroborate
it
in
any
way
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
that
the
douglases
were
very
attached
to
each
other
that
i
am
sure
cannot
be
true
said
i
thinking
of
the
beautiful
smiling
face
in
the
garden
well
at
least
they
gave
that
impression
however
we
will
suppose
that
they
are
an
extraordinarily
astute
couple
who
deceive
everyone
upon
this
point
and
conspire
to
murder
the
husband
he
happens
to
be
a
man
over
whose
head
some
danger
hangs
we
have
only
their
word
for
that
holmes
looked
thoughtful
i
see
watson
you
are
sketching
out
a
theory
by
which
everything
they
say
from
the
beginning
is
false
according
to
your
idea
there
was
never
any
hidden
menace
or
secret
society
or
valley
of
fear
or
boss
macsomebody
or
anything
else
well
that
is
a
good
sweeping
generalization
let
us
see
what
that
brings
us
to
they
invent
this
theory
to
account
for
the
crime
they
then
play
up
to
the
idea
by
leaving
this
bicycle
in
the
park
as
proof
of
the
existence
of
some
outsider
the
stain
on
the
windowsill
conveys
the
same
idea
so
does
the
card
on
the
body
which
might
have
been
prepared
in
the
house
that
all
fits
into
your
hypothesis
watson
but
now
we
come
on
the
nasty
angular
uncompromising
bits
which
won
t
slip
into
their
places
why
a
cut
off
shotgun
of
all
weapons
and
an
american
one
at
that
how
could
they
be
so
sure
that
the
sound
of
it
would
not
bring
someone
on
to
them
it
s
a
mere
chance
as
it
is
that
mrs
allen
did
not
start
out
to
inquire
for
the
slamming
door
why
did
your
guilty
couple
do
all
this
watson
i
confess
that
i
can
t
explain
it
then
again
if
a
woman
and
her
lover
conspire
to
murder
a
husband
are
they
going
to
advertise
their
guilt
by
ostentatiously
removing
his
wedding
ring
after
his
death
does
that
strike
you
as
very
probable
watson
no
it
does
not
and
once
again
if
the
thought
of
leaving
a
bicycle
concealed
outside
had
occurred
to
you
would
it
really
have
seemed
worth
doing
when
the
dullest
detective
would
naturally
say
this
is
an
obvious
blind
as
the
bicycle
is
the
first
thing
which
the
fugitive
needed
in
order
to
make
his
escape
i
can
conceive
of
no
explanation
and
yet
there
should
be
no
combination
of
events
for
which
the
wit
of
man
cannot
conceive
an
explanation
simply
as
a
mental
exercise
without
any
assertion
that
it
is
true
let
me
indicate
a
possible
line
of
thought
it
is
i
admit
mere
imagination
but
how
often
is
imagination
the
mother
of
truth
we
will
suppose
that
there
was
a
guilty
secret
a
really
shameful
secret
in
the
life
of
this
man
douglas
this
leads
to
his
murder
by
someone
who
is
we
will
suppose
an
avenger
someone
from
outside
this
avenger
for
some
reason
which
i
confess
i
am
still
at
a
loss
to
explain
took
the
dead
man
s
wedding
ring
the
vendetta
might
conceivably
date
back
to
the
man
s
first
marriage
and
the
ring
be
taken
for
some
such
reason
before
this
avenger
got
away
barker
and
the
wife
had
reached
the
room
the
assassin
convinced
them
that
any
attempt
to
arrest
him
would
lead
to
the
publication
of
some
hideous
scandal
they
were
converted
to
this
idea
and
preferred
to
let
him
go
for
this
purpose
they
probably
lowered
the
bridge
which
can
be
done
quite
noiselessly
and
then
raised
it
again
he
made
his
escape
and
for
some
reason
thought
that
he
could
do
so
more
safely
on
foot
than
on
the
bicycle
he
therefore
left
his
machine
where
it
would
not
be
discovered
until
he
had
got
safely
away
so
far
we
are
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
are
we
not
well
it
is
possible
no
doubt
said
i
with
some
reserve
we
have
to
remember
watson
that
whatever
occurred
is
certainly
something
very
extraordinary
well
now
to
continue
our
supposititious
case
the
couple
not
necessarily
a
guilty
couple
realize
after
the
murderer
is
gone
that
they
have
placed
themselves
in
a
position
in
which
it
may
be
difficult
for
them
to
prove
that
they
did
not
themselves
either
do
the
deed
or
connive
at
it
they
rapidly
and
rather
clumsily
met
the
situation
the
mark
was
put
by
barker
s
bloodstained
slipper
upon
the
windowsill
to
suggest
how
the
fugitive
got
away
they
obviously
were
the
two
who
must
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
gun
so
they
gave
the
alarm
exactly
as
they
would
have
done
but
a
good
half
hour
after
the
event
and
how
do
you
propose
to
prove
all
this
well
if
there
were
an
outsider
he
may
be
traced
and
taken
that
would
be
the
most
effective
of
all
proofs
but
if
not
well
the
resources
of
science
are
far
from
being
exhausted
i
think
that
an
evening
alone
in
that
study
would
help
me
much
an
evening
alone
i
propose
to
go
up
there
presently
i
have
arranged
it
with
the
estimable
ames
who
is
by
no
means
wholehearted
about
barker
i
shall
sit
in
that
room
and
see
if
its
atmosphere
brings
me
inspiration
i
m
a
believer
in
the
genius
loci
you
smile
friend
watson
well
we
shall
see
by
the
way
you
have
that
big
umbrella
of
yours
have
you
not
it
is
here
well
i
ll
borrow
that
if
i
may
certainly
but
what
a
wretched
weapon
if
there
is
danger
nothing
serious
my
dear
watson
or
i
should
certainly
ask
for
your
assistance
but
i
ll
take
the
umbrella
at
present
i
am
only
awaiting
the
return
of
our
colleagues
from
tunbridge
wells
where
they
are
at
present
engaged
in
trying
for
a
likely
owner
to
the
bicycle
it
was
nightfall
before
inspector
macdonald
and
white
mason
came
back
from
their
expedition
and
they
arrived
exultant
reporting
a
great
advance
in
our
investigation
man
i
ll
admeet
that
i
had
my
doubts
if
there
was
ever
an
outsider
said
macdonald
but
that
s
all
past
now
we
ve
had
the
bicycle
identified
and
we
have
a
description
of
our
man
so
that
s
a
long
step
on
our
journey
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
beginning
of
the
end
said
holmes
i
m
sure
i
congratulate
you
both
with
all
my
heart
well
i
started
from
the
fact
that
mr
douglas
had
seemed
disturbed
since
the
day
before
when
he
had
been
at
tunbridge
wells
it
was
at
tunbridge
wells
then
that
he
had
become
conscious
of
some
danger
it
was
clear
therefore
that
if
a
man
had
come
over
with
a
bicycle
it
was
from
tunbridge
wells
that
he
might
be
expected
to
have
come
we
took
the
bicycle
over
with
us
and
showed
it
at
the
hotels
it
was
identified
at
once
by
the
manager
of
the
eagle
commercial
as
belonging
to
a
man
named
hargrave
who
had
taken
a
room
there
two
days
before
this
bicycle
and
a
small
valise
were
his
whole
belongings
he
had
registered
his
name
as
coming
from
london
but
had
given
no
address
the
valise
was
london
made
and
the
contents
were
british
but
the
man
himself
was
undoubtedly
an
american
well
well
said
holmes
gleefully
you
have
indeed
done
some
solid
work
while
i
have
been
sitting
spinning
theories
with
my
friend
it
s
a
lesson
in
being
practical
mr
mac
ay
it
s
just
that
mr
holmes
said
the
inspector
with
satisfaction
but
this
may
all
fit
in
with
your
theories
i
remarked
that
may
or
may
not
be
but
let
us
hear
the
end
mr
mac
was
there
nothing
to
identify
this
man
so
little
that
it
was
evident
that
he
had
carefully
guarded
himself
against
identification
there
were
no
papers
or
letters
and
no
marking
upon
the
clothes
a
cycle
map
of
the
county
lay
on
his
bedroom
table
he
had
left
the
hotel
after
breakfast
yesterday
morning
on
his
bicycle
and
no
more
was
heard
of
him
until
our
inquiries
that
s
what
puzzles
me
mr
holmes
said
white
mason
if
the
fellow
did
not
want
the
hue
and
cry
raised
over
him
one
would
imagine
that
he
would
have
returned
and
remained
at
the
hotel
as
an
inoffensive
tourist
as
it
is
he
must
know
that
he
will
be
reported
to
the
police
by
the
hotel
manager
and
that
his
disappearance
will
be
connected
with
the
murder
so
one
would
imagine
still
he
has
been
justified
of
his
wisdom
up
to
date
at
any
rate
since
he
has
not
been
taken
but
his
description
what
of
that
macdonald
referred
to
his
notebook
here
we
have
it
so
far
as
they
could
give
it
they
don
t
seem
to
have
taken
any
very
particular
stock
of
him
but
still
the
porter
the
clerk
and
the
chambermaid
are
all
agreed
that
this
about
covers
the
points
he
was
a
man
about
five
foot
nine
in
height
fifty
or
so
years
of
age
his
hair
slightly
grizzled
a
grayish
moustache
a
curved
nose
and
a
face
which
all
of
them
described
as
fierce
and
forbidding
well
bar
the
expression
that
might
almost
be
a
description
of
douglas
himself
said
holmes
he
is
just
over
fifty
with
grizzled
hair
and
moustache
and
about
the
same
height
did
you
get
anything
else
he
was
dressed
in
a
heavy
gray
suit
with
a
reefer
jacket
and
he
wore
a
short
yellow
overcoat
and
a
soft
cap
what
about
the
shotgun
it
is
less
than
two
feet
long
it
could
very
well
have
fitted
into
his
valise
he
could
have
carried
it
inside
his
overcoat
without
difficulty
and
how
do
you
consider
that
all
this
bears
upon
the
general
case
well
mr
holmes
said
macdonald
when
we
have
got
our
man
and
you
may
be
sure
that
i
had
his
description
on
the
wires
within
five
minutes
of
hearing
it
we
shall
be
better
able
to
judge
but
even
as
it
stands
we
have
surely
gone
a
long
way
we
know
that
an
american
calling
himself
hargrave
came
to
tunbridge
wells
two
days
ago
with
bicycle
and
valise
in
the
latter
was
a
sawed
off
shotgun
so
he
came
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
crime
yesterday
morning
he
set
off
for
this
place
on
his
bicycle
with
his
gun
concealed
in
his
overcoat
no
one
saw
him
arrive
so
far
as
we
can
learn
but
he
need
not
pass
through
the
village
to
reach
the
park
gates
and
there
are
many
cyclists
upon
the
road
presumably
he
at
once
concealed
his
cycle
among
the
laurels
where
it
was
found
and
possibly
lurked
there
himself
with
his
eye
on
the
house
waiting
for
mr
douglas
to
come
out
the
shotgun
is
a
strange
weapon
to
use
inside
a
house
but
he
had
intended
to
use
it
outside
and
there
it
has
very
obvious
advantages
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
miss
with
it
and
the
sound
of
shots
is
so
common
in
an
english
sporting
neighbourhood
that
no
particular
notice
would
be
taken
that
is
all
very
clear
said
holmes
well
mr
douglas
did
not
appear
what
was
he
to
do
next
he
left
his
bicycle
and
approached
the
house
in
the
twilight
he
found
the
bridge
down
and
no
one
about
he
took
his
chance
intending
no
doubt
to
make
some
excuse
if
he
met
anyone
he
met
no
one
he
slipped
into
the
first
room
that
he
saw
and
concealed
himself
behind
the
curtain
thence
he
could
see
the
drawbridge
go
up
and
he
knew
that
his
only
escape
was
through
the
moat
he
waited
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
mr
douglas
upon
his
usual
nightly
round
came
into
the
room
he
shot
him
and
escaped
as
arranged
he
was
aware
that
the
bicycle
would
be
described
by
the
hotel
people
and
be
a
clue
against
him
so
he
left
it
there
and
made
his
way
by
some
other
means
to
london
or
to
some
safe
hiding
place
which
he
had
already
arranged
how
is
that
mr
holmes
well
mr
mac
it
is
very
good
and
very
clear
so
far
as
it
goes
that
is
your
end
of
the
story
my
end
is
that
the
crime
was
committed
half
an
hour
earlier
than
reported
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
are
both
in
a
conspiracy
to
conceal
something
that
they
aided
the
murderer
s
escape
or
at
least
that
they
reached
the
room
before
he
escaped
and
that
they
fabricated
evidence
of
his
escape
through
the
window
whereas
in
all
probability
they
had
themselves
let
him
go
by
lowering
the
bridge
that
s
my
reading
of
the
first
half
the
two
detectives
shook
their
heads
well
mr
holmes
if
this
is
true
we
only
tumble
out
of
one
mystery
into
another
said
the
london
inspector
and
in
some
ways
a
worse
one
added
white
mason
the
lady
has
never
been
in
america
in
all
her
life
what
possible
connection
could
she
have
with
an
american
assassin
which
would
cause
her
to
shelter
him
i
freely
admit
the
difficulties
said
holmes
i
propose
to
make
a
little
investigation
of
my
own
to
night
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
contribute
something
to
the
common
cause
can
we
help
you
mr
holmes
no
no
darkness
and
dr
watson
s
umbrella
my
wants
are
simple
and
ames
the
faithful
ames
no
doubt
he
will
stretch
a
point
for
me
all
my
lines
of
thought
lead
me
back
invariably
to
the
one
basic
question
why
should
an
athletic
man
develop
his
frame
upon
so
unnatural
an
instrument
as
a
single
dumb
bell
it
was
late
that
night
when
holmes
returned
from
his
solitary
excursion
we
slept
in
a
double
bedded
room
which
was
the
best
that
the
little
country
inn
could
do
for
us
i
was
already
asleep
when
i
was
partly
awakened
by
his
entrance
well
holmes
i
murmured
have
you
found
anything
out
he
stood
beside
me
in
silence
his
candle
in
his
hand
then
the
tall
lean
figure
inclined
towards
me
i
say
watson
he
whispered
would
you
be
afraid
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
a
lunatic
a
man
with
softening
of
the
brain
an
idiot
whose
mind
has
lost
its
grip
not
in
the
least
i
answered
in
astonishment
ah
that
s
lucky
he
said
and
not
another
word
would
he
utter
that
night
chapter
the
solution
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
found
inspector
macdonald
and
white
mason
seated
in
close
consultation
in
the
small
parlour
of
the
local
police
sergeant
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
were
piled
a
number
of
letters
and
telegrams
which
they
were
carefully
sorting
and
docketing
three
had
been
placed
on
one
side
still
on
the
track
of
the
elusive
bicyclist
holmes
asked
cheerfully
what
is
the
latest
news
of
the
ruffian
macdonald
pointed
ruefully
to
his
heap
of
correspondence
he
is
at
present
reported
from
leicester
nottingham
southampton
derby
east
ham
richmond
and
fourteen
other
places
in
three
of
them
east
ham
leicester
and
liverpool
there
is
a
clear
case
against
him
and
he
has
actually
been
arrested
the
country
seems
to
be
full
of
the
fugitives
with
yellow
coats
dear
me
said
holmes
sympathetically
now
mr
mac
and
you
mr
white
mason
i
wish
to
give
you
a
very
earnest
piece
of
advice
when
i
went
into
this
case
with
you
i
bargained
as
you
will
no
doubt
remember
that
i
should
not
present
you
with
half
proved
theories
but
that
i
should
retain
and
work
out
my
own
ideas
until
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
they
were
correct
for
this
reason
i
am
not
at
the
present
moment
telling
you
all
that
is
in
my
mind
on
the
other
hand
i
said
that
i
would
play
the
game
fairly
by
you
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fair
game
to
allow
you
for
one
unnecessary
moment
to
waste
your
energies
upon
a
profitless
task
therefore
i
am
here
to
advise
you
this
morning
and
my
advice
to
you
is
summed
up
in
three
words
abandon
the
case
macdonald
and
white
mason
stared
in
amazement
at
their
celebrated
colleague
you
consider
it
hopeless
cried
the
inspector
i
consider
your
case
to
be
hopeless
i
do
not
consider
that
it
is
hopeless
to
arrive
at
the
truth
but
this
cyclist
he
is
not
an
invention
we
have
his
description
his
valise
his
bicycle
the
fellow
must
be
somewhere
why
should
we
not
get
him
yes
yes
no
doubt
he
is
somewhere
and
no
doubt
we
shall
get
him
but
i
would
not
have
you
waste
your
energies
in
east
ham
or
liverpool
i
am
sure
that
we
can
find
some
shorter
cut
to
a
result
you
are
holding
something
back
it
s
hardly
fair
of
you
mr
holmes
the
inspector
was
annoyed
you
know
my
methods
of
work
mr
mac
but
i
will
hold
it
back
for
the
shortest
time
possible
i
only
wish
to
verify
my
details
in
one
way
which
can
very
readily
be
done
and
then
i
make
my
bow
and
return
to
london
leaving
my
results
entirely
at
your
service
i
owe
you
too
much
to
act
otherwise
for
in
all
my
experience
i
cannot
recall
any
more
singular
and
interesting
study
this
is
clean
beyond
me
mr
holmes
we
saw
you
when
we
returned
from
tunbridge
wells
last
night
and
you
were
in
general
agreement
with
our
results
what
has
happened
since
then
to
give
you
a
completely
new
idea
of
the
case
well
since
you
ask
me
i
spent
as
i
told
you
that
i
would
some
hours
last
night
at
the
manor
house
well
what
happened
ah
i
can
only
give
you
a
very
general
answer
to
that
for
the
moment
by
the
way
i
have
been
reading
a
short
but
clear
and
interesting
account
of
the
old
building
purchasable
at
the
modest
sum
of
one
penny
from
the
local
tobacconist
here
holmes
drew
a
small
tract
embellished
with
a
rude
engraving
of
the
ancient
manor
house
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
immensely
adds
to
the
zest
of
an
investigation
my
dear
mr
mac
when
one
is
in
conscious
sympathy
with
the
historical
atmosphere
of
one
s
surroundings
don
t
look
so
impatient
for
i
assure
you
that
even
so
bald
an
account
as
this
raises
some
sort
of
picture
of
the
past
in
one
s
mind
permit
me
to
give
you
a
sample
erected
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
james
i
and
standing
upon
the
site
of
a
much
older
building
the
manor
house
of
birlstone
presents
one
of
the
finest
surviving
examples
of
the
moated
jacobean
residence
you
are
making
fools
of
us
mr
holmes
tut
tut
mr
mac
the
first
sign
of
temper
i
have
detected
in
you
well
i
won
t
read
it
verbatim
since
you
feel
so
strongly
upon
the
subject
but
when
i
tell
you
that
there
is
some
account
of
the
taking
of
the
place
by
a
parliamentary
colonel
in
of
the
concealment
of
charles
for
several
days
in
the
course
of
the
civil
war
and
finally
of
a
visit
there
by
the
second
george
you
will
admit
that
there
are
various
associations
of
interest
connected
with
this
ancient
house
i
don
t
doubt
it
mr
holmes
but
that
is
no
business
of
ours
is
it
not
is
it
not
breadth
of
view
my
dear
mr
mac
is
one
of
the
essentials
of
our
profession
the
interplay
of
ideas
and
the
oblique
uses
of
knowledge
are
often
of
extraordinary
interest
you
will
excuse
these
remarks
from
one
who
though
a
mere
connoisseur
of
crime
is
still
rather
older
and
perhaps
more
experienced
than
yourself
i
m
the
first
to
admit
that
said
the
detective
heartily
you
get
to
your
point
i
admit
but
you
have
such
a
deuced
round
the
corner
way
of
doing
it
well
well
i
ll
drop
past
history
and
get
down
to
present
day
facts
i
called
last
night
as
i
have
already
said
at
the
manor
house
i
did
not
see
either
barker
or
mrs
douglas
i
saw
no
necessity
to
disturb
them
but
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
the
lady
was
not
visibly
pining
and
that
she
had
partaken
of
an
excellent
dinner
my
visit
was
specially
made
to
the
good
mr
ames
with
whom
i
exchanged
some
amiabilities
which
culminated
in
his
allowing
me
without
reference
to
anyone
else
to
sit
alone
for
a
time
in
the
study
what
with
that
i
ejaculated
no
no
everything
is
now
in
order
you
gave
permission
for
that
mr
mac
as
i
am
informed
the
room
was
in
its
normal
state
and
in
it
i
passed
an
instructive
quarter
of
an
hour
what
were
you
doing
well
not
to
make
a
mystery
of
so
simple
a
matter
i
was
looking
for
the
missing
dumb
bell
it
has
always
bulked
rather
large
in
my
estimate
of
the
case
i
ended
by
finding
it
where
ah
there
we
come
to
the
edge
of
the
unexplored
let
me
go
a
little
further
a
very
little
further
and
i
will
promise
that
you
shall
share
everything
that
i
know
well
we
re
bound
to
take
you
on
your
own
terms
said
the
inspector
but
when
it
comes
to
telling
us
to
abandon
the
case
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
should
we
abandon
the
case
for
the
simple
reason
my
dear
mr
mac
that
you
have
not
got
the
first
idea
what
it
is
that
you
are
investigating
we
are
investigating
the
murder
of
mr
john
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
yes
yes
so
you
are
but
don
t
trouble
to
trace
the
mysterious
gentleman
upon
the
bicycle
i
assure
you
that
it
won
t
help
you
then
what
do
you
suggest
that
we
do
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
if
you
will
do
it
well
i
m
bound
to
say
i
ve
always
found
you
had
reason
behind
all
your
queer
ways
i
ll
do
what
you
advise
and
you
mr
white
mason
the
country
detective
looked
helplessly
from
one
to
the
other
holmes
and
his
methods
were
new
to
him
well
if
it
is
good
enough
for
the
inspector
it
is
good
enough
for
me
he
said
at
last
capital
said
holmes
well
then
i
should
recommend
a
nice
cheery
country
walk
for
both
of
you
they
tell
me
that
the
views
from
birlstone
ridge
over
the
weald
are
very
remarkable
no
doubt
lunch
could
be
got
at
some
suitable
hostelry
though
my
ignorance
of
the
country
prevents
me
from
recommending
one
in
the
evening
tired
but
happy
man
this
is
getting
past
a
joke
cried
macdonald
rising
angrily
from
his
chair
well
well
spend
the
day
as
you
like
said
holmes
patting
him
cheerfully
upon
the
shoulder
do
what
you
like
and
go
where
you
will
but
meet
me
here
before
dusk
without
fail
without
fail
mr
mac
that
sounds
more
like
sanity
all
of
it
was
excellent
advice
but
i
don
t
insist
so
long
as
you
are
here
when
i
need
you
but
now
before
we
part
i
want
you
to
write
a
note
to
mr
barker
well
i
ll
dictate
it
if
you
like
ready
dear
sir
it
has
struck
me
that
it
is
our
duty
to
drain
the
moat
in
the
hope
that
we
may
find
some
it
s
impossible
said
the
inspector
i
ve
made
inquiry
tut
tut
my
dear
sir
please
do
what
i
ask
you
well
go
on
in
the
hope
that
we
may
find
something
which
may
bear
upon
our
investigation
i
have
made
arrangements
and
the
workmen
will
be
at
work
early
to
morrow
morning
diverting
the
stream
impossible
diverting
the
stream
so
i
thought
it
best
to
explain
matters
beforehand
now
sign
that
and
send
it
by
hand
about
four
o
clock
at
that
hour
we
shall
meet
again
in
this
room
until
then
we
may
each
do
what
we
like
for
i
can
assure
you
that
this
inquiry
has
come
to
a
definite
pause
evening
was
drawing
in
when
we
reassembled
holmes
was
very
serious
in
his
manner
myself
curious
and
the
detectives
obviously
critical
and
annoyed
well
gentlemen
said
my
friend
gravely
i
am
asking
you
now
to
put
everything
to
the
test
with
me
and
you
will
judge
for
yourselves
whether
the
observations
i
have
made
justify
the
conclusions
to
which
i
have
come
it
is
a
chill
evening
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
our
expedition
may
last
so
i
beg
that
you
will
wear
your
warmest
coats
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
we
should
be
in
our
places
before
it
grows
dark
so
with
your
permission
we
shall
get
started
at
once
we
passed
along
the
outer
bounds
of
the
manor
house
park
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
gap
in
the
rails
which
fenced
it
through
this
we
slipped
and
then
in
the
gathering
gloom
we
followed
holmes
until
we
had
reached
a
shrubbery
which
lies
nearly
opposite
to
the
main
door
and
the
drawbridge
the
latter
had
not
been
raised
holmes
crouched
down
behind
the
screen
of
laurels
and
we
all
three
followed
his
example
well
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
macdonald
with
some
gruffness
possess
our
souls
in
patience
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
holmes
answered
what
are
we
here
for
at
all
i
really
think
that
you
might
treat
us
with
more
frankness
holmes
laughed
watson
insists
that
i
am
the
dramatist
in
real
life
said
he
some
touch
of
the
artist
wells
up
within
me
and
calls
insistently
for
a
well
staged
performance
surely
our
profession
mr
mac
would
be
a
drab
and
sordid
one
if
we
did
not
sometimes
set
the
scene
so
as
to
glorify
our
results
the
blunt
accusation
the
brutal
tap
upon
the
shoulder
what
can
one
make
of
such
a
denouement
but
the
quick
inference
the
subtle
trap
the
clever
forecast
of
coming
events
the
triumphant
vindication
of
bold
theories
are
these
not
the
pride
and
the
justification
of
our
life
s
work
at
the
present
moment
you
thrill
with
the
glamour
of
the
situation
and
the
anticipation
of
the
hunt
where
would
be
that
thrill
if
i
had
been
as
definite
as
a
timetable
i
only
ask
a
little
patience
mr
mac
and
all
will
be
clear
to
you
well
i
hope
the
pride
and
justification
and
the
rest
of
it
will
come
before
we
all
get
our
death
of
cold
said
the
london
detective
with
comic
resignation
we
all
had
good
reason
to
join
in
the
aspiration
for
our
vigil
was
a
long
and
bitter
one
slowly
the
shadows
darkened
over
the
long
sombre
face
of
the
old
house
a
cold
damp
reek
from
the
moat
chilled
us
to
the
bones
and
set
our
teeth
chattering
there
was
a
single
lamp
over
the
gateway
and
a
steady
globe
of
light
in
the
fatal
study
everything
else
was
dark
and
still
how
long
is
this
to
last
asked
the
inspector
finally
and
what
is
it
we
are
watching
for
i
have
no
more
notion
than
you
how
long
it
is
to
last
holmes
answered
with
some
asperity
if
criminals
would
always
schedule
their
movements
like
railway
trains
it
would
certainly
be
more
convenient
for
all
of
us
as
to
what
it
is
we
well
that
s
what
we
are
watching
for
as
he
spoke
the
bright
yellow
light
in
the
study
was
obscured
by
somebody
passing
to
and
fro
before
it
the
laurels
among
which
we
lay
were
immediately
opposite
the
window
and
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
it
presently
it
was
thrown
open
with
a
whining
of
hinges
and
we
could
dimly
see
the
dark
outline
of
a
man
s
head
and
shoulders
looking
out
into
the
gloom
for
some
minutes
he
peered
forth
in
furtive
stealthy
fashion
as
one
who
wishes
to
be
assured
that
he
is
unobserved
then
he
leaned
forward
and
in
the
intense
silence
we
were
aware
of
the
soft
lapping
of
agitated
water
he
seemed
to
be
stirring
up
the
moat
with
something
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
suddenly
he
hauled
something
in
as
a
fisherman
lands
a
fish
some
large
round
object
which
obscured
the
light
as
it
was
dragged
through
the
open
casement
now
cried
holmes
now
we
were
all
upon
our
feet
staggering
after
him
with
our
stiffened
limbs
while
he
ran
swiftly
across
the
bridge
and
rang
violently
at
the
bell
there
was
the
rasping
of
bolts
from
the
other
side
and
the
amazed
ames
stood
in
the
entrance
holmes
brushed
him
aside
without
a
word
and
followed
by
all
of
us
rushed
into
the
room
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
man
whom
we
had
been
watching
the
oil
lamp
on
the
table
represented
the
glow
which
we
had
seen
from
outside
it
was
now
in
the
hand
of
cecil
barker
who
held
it
towards
us
as
we
entered
its
light
shone
upon
his
strong
resolute
clean
shaved
face
and
his
menacing
eyes
what
the
devil
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
cried
what
are
you
after
anyhow
holmes
took
a
swift
glance
round
and
then
pounced
upon
a
sodden
bundle
tied
together
with
cord
which
lay
where
it
had
been
thrust
under
the
writing
table
this
is
what
we
are
after
mr
barker
this
bundle
weighted
with
a
dumb
bell
which
you
have
just
raised
from
the
bottom
of
the
moat
barker
stared
at
holmes
with
amazement
in
his
face
how
in
thunder
came
you
to
know
anything
about
it
he
asked
simply
that
i
put
it
there
you
put
it
there
you
perhaps
i
should
have
said
replaced
it
there
said
holmes
you
will
remember
inspector
macdonald
that
i
was
somewhat
struck
by
the
absence
of
a
dumb
bell
i
drew
your
attention
to
it
but
with
the
pressure
of
other
events
you
had
hardly
the
time
to
give
it
the
consideration
which
would
have
enabled
you
to
draw
deductions
from
it
when
water
is
near
and
a
weight
is
missing
it
is
not
a
very
far
fetched
supposition
that
something
has
been
sunk
in
the
water
the
idea
was
at
least
worth
testing
so
with
the
help
of
ames
who
admitted
me
to
the
room
and
the
crook
of
dr
watson
s
umbrella
i
was
able
last
night
to
fish
up
and
inspect
this
bundle
it
was
of
the
first
importance
however
that
we
should
be
able
to
prove
who
placed
it
there
this
we
accomplished
by
the
very
obvious
device
of
announcing
that
the
moat
would
be
dried
to
morrow
which
had
of
course
the
effect
that
whoever
had
hidden
the
bundle
would
most
certainly
withdraw
it
the
moment
that
darkness
enabled
him
to
do
so
we
have
no
less
than
four
witnesses
as
to
who
it
was
who
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
so
mr
barker
i
think
the
word
lies
now
with
you
sherlock
holmes
put
the
sopping
bundle
upon
the
table
beside
the
lamp
and
undid
the
cord
which
bound
it
from
within
he
extracted
a
dumb
bell
which
he
tossed
down
to
its
fellow
in
the
corner
next
he
drew
forth
a
pair
of
boots
american
as
you
perceive
he
remarked
pointing
to
the
toes
then
he
laid
upon
the
table
a
long
deadly
sheathed
knife
finally
he
unravelled
a
bundle
of
clothing
comprising
a
complete
set
of
underclothes
socks
a
gray
tweed
suit
and
a
short
yellow
overcoat
the
clothes
are
commonplace
remarked
holmes
save
only
the
overcoat
which
is
full
of
suggestive
touches
he
held
it
tenderly
towards
the
light
here
as
you
perceive
is
the
inner
pocket
prolonged
into
the
lining
in
such
fashion
as
to
give
ample
space
for
the
truncated
fowling
piece
the
tailor
s
tab
is
on
the
neck
neal
outfitter
vermissa
u
s
a
i
have
spent
an
instructive
afternoon
in
the
rector
s
library
and
have
enlarged
my
knowledge
by
adding
the
fact
that
vermissa
is
a
flourishing
little
town
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
best
known
coal
and
iron
valleys
in
the
united
states
i
have
some
recollection
mr
barker
that
you
associated
the
coal
districts
with
mr
douglas
s
first
wife
and
it
would
surely
not
be
too
far
fetched
an
inference
that
the
v
v
upon
the
card
by
the
dead
body
might
stand
for
vermissa
valley
or
that
this
very
valley
which
sends
forth
emissaries
of
murder
may
be
that
valley
of
fear
of
which
we
have
heard
so
much
is
fairly
clear
and
now
mr
barker
i
seem
to
be
standing
rather
in
the
way
of
your
explanation
it
was
a
sight
to
see
cecil
barker
s
expressive
face
during
this
exposition
of
the
great
detective
anger
amazement
consternation
and
indecision
swept
over
it
in
turn
finally
he
took
refuge
in
a
somewhat
acrid
irony
you
know
such
a
lot
mr
holmes
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
us
some
more
he
sneered
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
could
tell
you
a
great
deal
more
mr
barker
but
it
would
come
with
a
better
grace
from
you
oh
you
think
so
do
you
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
there
s
any
secret
here
it
is
not
my
secret
and
i
am
not
the
man
to
give
it
away
well
if
you
take
that
line
mr
barker
said
the
inspector
quietly
we
must
just
keep
you
in
sight
until
we
have
the
warrant
and
can
hold
you
you
can
do
what
you
damn
please
about
that
said
barker
defiantly
the
proceedings
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
definite
end
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
for
one
had
only
to
look
at
that
granite
face
to
realize
that
no
peine
forte
et
dure
would
ever
force
him
to
plead
against
his
will
the
deadlock
was
broken
however
by
a
woman
s
voice
mrs
douglas
had
been
standing
listening
at
the
half
opened
door
and
now
she
entered
the
room
you
have
done
enough
for
now
cecil
said
she
whatever
comes
of
it
in
the
future
you
have
done
enough
enough
and
more
than
enough
remarked
sherlock
holmes
gravely
i
have
every
sympathy
with
you
madam
and
should
strongly
urge
you
to
have
some
confidence
in
the
common
sense
of
our
jurisdiction
and
to
take
the
police
voluntarily
into
your
complete
confidence
it
may
be
that
i
am
myself
at
fault
for
not
following
up
the
hint
which
you
conveyed
to
me
through
my
friend
dr
watson
but
at
that
time
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
you
were
directly
concerned
in
the
crime
now
i
am
assured
that
this
is
not
so
at
the
same
time
there
is
much
that
is
unexplained
and
i
should
strongly
recommend
that
you
ask
mr
douglas
to
tell
us
his
own
story
mrs
douglas
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
at
holmes
s
words
the
detectives
and
i
must
have
echoed
it
when
we
were
aware
of
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
emerged
from
the
wall
who
advanced
now
from
the
gloom
of
the
corner
in
which
he
had
appeared
mrs
douglas
turned
and
in
an
instant
her
arms
were
round
him
barker
had
seized
his
outstretched
hand
it
s
best
this
way
jack
his
wife
repeated
i
am
sure
that
it
is
best
indeed
yes
mr
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
i
am
sure
that
you
will
find
it
best
the
man
stood
blinking
at
us
with
the
dazed
look
of
one
who
comes
from
the
dark
into
the
light
it
was
a
remarkable
face
bold
gray
eyes
a
strong
short
clipped
grizzled
moustache
a
square
projecting
chin
and
a
humorous
mouth
he
took
a
good
look
at
us
all
and
then
to
my
amazement
he
advanced
to
me
and
handed
me
a
bundle
of
paper
i
ve
heard
of
you
said
he
in
a
voice
which
was
not
quite
english
and
not
quite
american
but
was
altogether
mellow
and
pleasing
you
are
the
historian
of
this
bunch
well
dr
watson
you
ve
never
had
such
a
story
as
that
pass
through
your
hands
before
and
i
ll
lay
my
last
dollar
on
that
tell
it
your
own
way
but
there
are
the
facts
and
you
can
t
miss
the
public
so
long
as
you
have
those
i
ve
been
cooped
up
two
days
and
i
ve
spent
the
daylight
hours
as
much
daylight
as
i
could
get
in
that
rat
trap
in
putting
the
thing
into
words
you
re
welcome
to
them
you
and
your
public
there
s
the
story
of
the
valley
of
fear
that
s
the
past
mr
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
quietly
what
we
desire
now
is
to
hear
your
story
of
the
present
you
ll
have
it
sir
said
douglas
may
i
smoke
as
i
talk
well
thank
you
mr
holmes
you
re
a
smoker
yourself
if
i
remember
right
and
you
ll
guess
what
it
is
to
be
sitting
for
two
days
with
tobacco
in
your
pocket
and
afraid
that
the
smell
will
give
you
away
he
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
sucked
at
the
cigar
which
holmes
had
handed
him
i
ve
heard
of
you
mr
holmes
i
never
guessed
that
i
should
meet
you
but
before
you
are
through
with
that
he
nodded
at
my
papers
you
will
say
i
ve
brought
you
something
fresh
inspector
macdonald
had
been
staring
at
the
newcomer
with
the
greatest
amazement
well
this
fairly
beats
me
he
cried
at
last
if
you
are
mr
john
douglas
of
birlstone
manor
then
whose
death
have
we
been
investigating
for
these
two
days
and
where
in
the
world
have
you
sprung
from
now
you
seemed
to
me
to
come
out
of
the
floor
like
a
jack
in
a
box
ah
mr
mac
said
holmes
shaking
a
reproving
forefinger
you
would
not
read
that
excellent
local
compilation
which
described
the
concealment
of
king
charles
people
did
not
hide
in
those
days
without
excellent
hiding
places
and
the
hiding
place
that
has
once
been
used
may
be
again
i
had
persuaded
myself
that
we
should
find
mr
douglas
under
this
roof
and
how
long
have
you
been
playing
this
trick
upon
us
mr
holmes
said
the
inspector
angrily
how
long
have
you
allowed
us
to
waste
ourselves
upon
a
search
that
you
knew
to
be
an
absurd
one
not
one
instant
my
dear
mr
mac
only
last
night
did
i
form
my
views
of
the
case
as
they
could
not
be
put
to
the
proof
until
this
evening
i
invited
you
and
your
colleague
to
take
a
holiday
for
the
day
pray
what
more
could
i
do
when
i
found
the
suit
of
clothes
in
the
moat
it
at
once
became
apparent
to
me
that
the
body
we
had
found
could
not
have
been
the
body
of
mr
john
douglas
at
all
but
must
be
that
of
the
bicyclist
from
tunbridge
wells
no
other
conclusion
was
possible
therefore
i
had
to
determine
where
mr
john
douglas
himself
could
be
and
the
balance
of
probability
was
that
with
the
connivance
of
his
wife
and
his
friend
he
was
concealed
in
a
house
which
had
such
conveniences
for
a
fugitive
and
awaiting
quieter
times
when
he
could
make
his
final
escape
well
you
figured
it
out
about
right
said
douglas
approvingly
i
thought
i
d
dodge
your
british
law
for
i
was
not
sure
how
i
stood
under
it
and
also
i
saw
my
chance
to
throw
these
hounds
once
for
all
off
my
track
mind
you
from
first
to
last
i
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
nothing
that
i
would
not
do
again
but
you
ll
judge
that
for
yourselves
when
i
tell
you
my
story
never
mind
warning
me
inspector
i
m
ready
to
stand
pat
upon
the
truth
i
m
not
going
to
begin
at
the
beginning
that
s
all
there
he
indicated
my
bundle
of
papers
and
a
mighty
queer
yarn
you
ll
find
it
it
all
comes
down
to
this
that
there
are
some
men
that
have
good
cause
to
hate
me
and
would
give
their
last
dollar
to
know
that
they
had
got
me
so
long
as
i
am
alive
and
they
are
alive
there
is
no
safety
in
this
world
for
me
they
hunted
me
from
chicago
to
california
then
they
chased
me
out
of
america
but
when
i
married
and
settled
down
in
this
quiet
spot
i
thought
my
last
years
were
going
to
be
peaceable
i
never
explained
to
my
wife
how
things
were
why
should
i
pull
her
into
it
she
would
never
have
a
quiet
moment
again
but
would
always
be
imagining
trouble
i
fancy
she
knew
something
for
i
may
have
dropped
a
word
here
or
a
word
there
but
until
yesterday
after
you
gentlemen
had
seen
her
she
never
knew
the
rights
of
the
matter
she
told
you
all
she
knew
and
so
did
barker
here
for
on
the
night
when
this
thing
happened
there
was
mighty
little
time
for
explanations
she
knows
everything
now
and
i
would
have
been
a
wiser
man
if
i
had
told
her
sooner
but
it
was
a
hard
question
dear
he
took
her
hand
for
an
instant
in
his
own
and
i
acted
for
the
best
well
gentlemen
the
day
before
these
happenings
i
was
over
in
tunbridge
wells
and
i
got
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
the
street
it
was
only
a
glimpse
but
i
have
a
quick
eye
for
these
things
and
i
never
doubted
who
it
was
it
was
the
worst
enemy
i
had
among
them
all
one
who
has
been
after
me
like
a
hungry
wolf
after
a
caribou
all
these
years
i
knew
there
was
trouble
coming
and
i
came
home
and
made
ready
for
it
i
guessed
i
d
fight
through
it
all
right
on
my
own
my
luck
was
a
proverb
in
the
states
about
i
never
doubted
that
it
would
be
with
me
still
i
was
on
my
guard
all
that
next
day
and
never
went
out
into
the
park
it
s
as
well
or
he
d
have
had
the
drop
on
me
with
that
buckshot
gun
of
his
before
ever
i
could
draw
on
him
after
the
bridge
was
up
my
mind
was
always
more
restful
when
that
bridge
was
up
in
the
evenings
i
put
the
thing
clear
out
of
my
head
i
never
dreamed
of
his
getting
into
the
house
and
waiting
for
me
but
when
i
made
my
round
in
my
dressing
gown
as
was
my
habit
i
had
no
sooner
entered
the
study
than
i
scented
danger
i
guess
when
a
man
has
had
dangers
in
his
life
and
i
ve
had
more
than
most
in
my
time
there
is
a
kind
of
sixth
sense
that
waves
the
red
flag
i
saw
the
signal
clear
enough
and
yet
i
couldn
t
tell
you
why
next
instant
i
spotted
a
boot
under
the
window
curtain
and
then
i
saw
why
plain
enough
i
d
just
the
one
candle
that
was
in
my
hand
but
there
was
a
good
light
from
the
hall
lamp
through
the
open
door
i
put
down
the
candle
and
jumped
for
a
hammer
that
i
d
left
on
the
mantel
at
the
same
moment
he
sprang
at
me
i
saw
the
glint
of
a
knife
and
i
lashed
at
him
with
the
hammer
i
got
him
somewhere
for
the
knife
tinkled
down
on
the
floor
he
dodged
round
the
table
as
quick
as
an
eel
and
a
moment
later
he
d
got
his
gun
from
under
his
coat
i
heard
him
cock
it
but
i
had
got
hold
of
it
before
he
could
fire
i
had
it
by
the
barrel
and
we
wrestled
for
it
all
ends
up
for
a
minute
or
more
it
was
death
to
the
man
that
lost
his
grip
he
never
lost
his
grip
but
he
got
it
butt
downward
for
a
moment
too
long
maybe
it
was
i
that
pulled
the
trigger
maybe
we
just
jolted
it
off
between
us
anyhow
he
got
both
barrels
in
the
face
and
there
i
was
staring
down
at
all
that
was
left
of
ted
baldwin
i
d
recognized
him
in
the
township
and
again
when
he
sprang
for
me
but
his
own
mother
wouldn
t
recognize
him
as
i
saw
him
then
i
m
used
to
rough
work
but
i
fairly
turned
sick
at
the
sight
of
him
i
was
hanging
on
the
side
of
the
table
when
barker
came
hurrying
down
i
heard
my
wife
coming
and
i
ran
to
the
door
and
stopped
her
it
was
no
sight
for
a
woman
i
promised
i
d
come
to
her
soon
i
said
a
word
or
two
to
barker
he
took
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
we
waited
for
the
rest
to
come
along
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
then
we
understood
that
they
could
hear
nothing
and
that
all
that
had
happened
was
known
only
to
ourselves
it
was
at
that
instant
that
the
idea
came
to
me
i
was
fairly
dazzled
by
the
brilliance
of
it
the
man
s
sleeve
had
slipped
up
and
there
was
the
branded
mark
of
the
lodge
upon
his
forearm
see
here
the
man
whom
we
had
known
as
douglas
turned
up
his
own
coat
and
cuff
to
show
a
brown
triangle
within
a
circle
exactly
like
that
which
we
had
seen
upon
the
dead
man
it
was
the
sight
of
that
which
started
me
on
it
i
seemed
to
see
it
all
clear
at
a
glance
there
were
his
height
and
hair
and
figure
about
the
same
as
my
own
no
one
could
swear
to
his
face
poor
devil
i
brought
down
this
suit
of
clothes
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
barker
and
i
had
put
my
dressing
gown
on
him
and
he
lay
as
you
found
him
we
tied
all
his
things
into
a
bundle
and
i
weighted
them
with
the
only
weight
i
could
find
and
put
them
through
the
window
the
card
he
had
meant
to
lay
upon
my
body
was
lying
beside
his
own
my
rings
were
put
on
his
finger
but
when
it
came
to
the
wedding
ring
he
held
out
his
muscular
hand
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
i
had
struck
the
limit
i
have
not
moved
it
since
the
day
i
was
married
and
it
would
have
taken
a
file
to
get
it
off
i
don
t
know
anyhow
that
i
should
have
cared
to
part
with
it
but
if
i
had
wanted
to
i
couldn
t
so
we
just
had
to
leave
that
detail
to
take
care
of
itself
on
the
other
hand
i
brought
a
bit
of
plaster
down
and
put
it
where
i
am
wearing
one
myself
at
this
instant
you
slipped
up
there
mr
holmes
clever
as
you
are
for
if
you
had
chanced
to
take
off
that
plaster
you
would
have
found
no
cut
underneath
it
well
that
was
the
situation
if
i
could
lie
low
for
a
while
and
then
get
away
where
i
could
be
joined
by
my
widow
we
should
have
a
chance
at
last
of
living
in
peace
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
these
devils
would
give
me
no
rest
so
long
as
i
was
above
ground
but
if
they
saw
in
the
papers
that
baldwin
had
got
his
man
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
my
troubles
i
hadn
t
much
time
to
make
it
all
clear
to
barker
and
to
my
wife
but
they
understood
enough
to
be
able
to
help
me
i
knew
all
about
this
hiding
place
so
did
ames
but
it
never
entered
his
head
to
connect
it
with
the
matter
i
retired
into
it
and
it
was
up
to
barker
to
do
the
rest
i
guess
you
can
fill
in
for
yourselves
what
he
did
he
opened
the
window
and
made
the
mark
on
the
sill
to
give
an
idea
of
how
the
murderer
escaped
it
was
a
tall
order
that
but
as
the
bridge
was
up
there
was
no
other
way
then
when
everything
was
fixed
he
rang
the
bell
for
all
he
was
worth
what
happened
afterward
you
know
and
so
gentlemen
you
can
do
what
you
please
but
i
ve
told
you
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
so
help
me
god
what
i
ask
you
now
is
how
do
i
stand
by
the
english
law
there
was
a
silence
which
was
broken
by
sherlock
holmes
the
english
law
is
in
the
main
a
just
law
you
will
get
no
worse
than
your
deserts
from
that
mr
douglas
but
i
would
ask
you
how
did
this
man
know
that
you
lived
here
or
how
to
get
into
your
house
or
where
to
hide
to
get
you
i
know
nothing
of
this
holmes
s
face
was
very
white
and
grave
the
story
is
not
over
yet
i
fear
said
he
you
may
find
worse
dangers
than
the
english
law
or
even
than
your
enemies
from
america
i
see
trouble
before
you
mr
douglas
you
ll
take
my
advice
and
still
be
on
your
guard
and
now
my
long
suffering
readers
i
will
ask
you
to
come
away
with
me
for
a
time
far
from
the
sussex
manor
house
of
birlstone
and
far
also
from
the
year
of
grace
in
which
we
made
our
eventful
journey
which
ended
with
the
strange
story
of
the
man
who
had
been
known
as
john
douglas
i
wish
you
to
journey
back
some
twenty
years
in
time
and
westward
some
thousands
of
miles
in
space
that
i
may
lay
before
you
a
singular
and
terrible
narrative
so
singular
and
so
terrible
that
you
may
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
even
as
i
tell
it
even
so
did
it
occur
do
not
think
that
i
intrude
one
story
before
another
is
finished
as
you
read
on
you
will
find
that
this
is
not
so
and
when
i
have
detailed
those
distant
events
and
you
have
solved
this
mystery
of
the
past
we
shall
meet
once
more
in
those
rooms
on
baker
street
where
this
like
so
many
other
wonderful
happenings
will
find
its
end
part
the
scowrers
chapter
the
man
it
was
the
fourth
of
february
in
the
year
it
had
been
a
severe
winter
and
the
snow
lay
deep
in
the
gorges
of
the
gilmerton
mountains
the
steam
ploughs
had
however
kept
the
railroad
open
and
the
evening
train
which
connects
the
long
line
of
coal
mining
and
iron
working
settlements
was
slowly
groaning
its
way
up
the
steep
gradients
which
lead
from
stagville
on
the
plain
to
vermissa
the
central
township
which
lies
at
the
head
of
vermissa
valley
from
this
point
the
track
sweeps
downward
to
bartons
crossing
helmdale
and
the
purely
agricultural
county
of
merton
it
was
a
single
track
railroad
but
at
every
siding
and
they
were
numerous
long
lines
of
trucks
piled
with
coal
and
iron
ore
told
of
the
hidden
wealth
which
had
brought
a
rude
population
and
a
bustling
life
to
this
most
desolate
corner
of
the
united
states
of
america
for
desolate
it
was
little
could
the
first
pioneer
who
had
traversed
it
have
ever
imagined
that
the
fairest
prairies
and
the
most
lush
water
pastures
were
valueless
compared
to
this
gloomy
land
of
black
crag
and
tangled
forest
above
the
dark
and
often
scarcely
penetrable
woods
upon
their
flanks
the
high
bare
crowns
of
the
mountains
white
snow
and
jagged
rock
towered
upon
each
flank
leaving
a
long
winding
tortuous
valley
in
the
centre
up
this
the
little
train
was
slowly
crawling
the
oil
lamps
had
just
been
lit
in
the
leading
passenger
car
a
long
bare
carriage
in
which
some
twenty
or
thirty
people
were
seated
the
greater
number
of
these
were
workmen
returning
from
their
day
s
toil
in
the
lower
part
of
the
valley
at
least
a
dozen
by
their
grimed
faces
and
the
safety
lanterns
which
they
carried
proclaimed
themselves
miners
these
sat
smoking
in
a
group
and
conversed
in
low
voices
glancing
occasionally
at
two
men
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
car
whose
uniforms
and
badges
showed
them
to
be
policemen
several
women
of
the
labouring
class
and
one
or
two
travellers
who
might
have
been
small
local
storekeepers
made
up
the
rest
of
the
company
with
the
exception
of
one
young
man
in
a
corner
by
himself
it
is
with
this
man
that
we
are
concerned
take
a
good
look
at
him
for
he
is
worth
it
he
is
a
fresh
complexioned
middle
sized
young
man
not
far
one
would
guess
from
his
thirtieth
year
he
has
large
shrewd
humorous
gray
eyes
which
twinkle
inquiringly
from
time
to
time
as
he
looks
round
through
his
spectacles
at
the
people
about
him
it
is
easy
to
see
that
he
is
of
a
sociable
and
possibly
simple
disposition
anxious
to
be
friendly
to
all
men
anyone
could
pick
him
at
once
as
gregarious
in
his
habits
and
communicative
in
his
nature
with
a
quick
wit
and
a
ready
smile
and
yet
the
man
who
studied
him
more
closely
might
discern
a
certain
firmness
of
jaw
and
grim
tightness
about
the
lips
which
would
warn
him
that
there
were
depths
beyond
and
that
this
pleasant
brown
haired
young
irishman
might
conceivably
leave
his
mark
for
good
or
evil
upon
any
society
to
which
he
was
introduced
having
made
one
or
two
tentative
remarks
to
the
nearest
miner
and
receiving
only
short
gruff
replies
the
traveller
resigned
himself
to
uncongenial
silence
staring
moodily
out
of
the
window
at
the
fading
landscape
it
was
not
a
cheering
prospect
through
the
growing
gloom
there
pulsed
the
red
glow
of
the
furnaces
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
great
heaps
of
slag
and
dumps
of
cinders
loomed
up
on
each
side
with
the
high
shafts
of
the
collieries
towering
above
them
huddled
groups
of
mean
wooden
houses
the
windows
of
which
were
beginning
to
outline
themselves
in
light
were
scattered
here
and
there
along
the
line
and
the
frequent
halting
places
were
crowded
with
their
swarthy
inhabitants
the
iron
and
coal
valleys
of
the
vermissa
district
were
no
resorts
for
the
leisured
or
the
cultured
everywhere
there
were
stern
signs
of
the
crudest
battle
of
life
the
rude
work
to
be
done
and
the
rude
strong
workers
who
did
it
the
young
traveller
gazed
out
into
this
dismal
country
with
a
face
of
mingled
repulsion
and
interest
which
showed
that
the
scene
was
new
to
him
at
intervals
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
bulky
letter
to
which
he
referred
and
on
the
margins
of
which
he
scribbled
some
notes
once
from
the
back
of
his
waist
he
produced
something
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
to
find
in
the
possession
of
so
mild
mannered
a
man
it
was
a
navy
revolver
of
the
largest
size
as
he
turned
it
slantwise
to
the
light
the
glint
upon
the
rims
of
the
copper
shells
within
the
drum
showed
that
it
was
fully
loaded
he
quickly
restored
it
to
his
secret
pocket
but
not
before
it
had
been
observed
by
a
working
man
who
had
seated
himself
upon
the
adjoining
bench
hullo
mate
said
he
you
seem
heeled
and
ready
the
young
man
smiled
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
yes
said
he
we
need
them
sometimes
in
the
place
i
come
from
and
where
may
that
be
i
m
last
from
chicago
a
stranger
in
these
parts
yes
you
may
find
you
need
it
here
said
the
workman
ah
is
that
so
the
young
man
seemed
interested
have
you
heard
nothing
of
doings
hereabouts
nothing
out
of
the
way
why
i
thought
the
country
was
full
of
it
you
ll
hear
quick
enough
what
made
you
come
here
i
heard
there
was
always
work
for
a
willing
man
are
you
a
member
of
the
union
sure
then
you
ll
get
your
job
i
guess
have
you
any
friends
not
yet
but
i
have
the
means
of
making
them
how
s
that
then
i
am
one
of
the
eminent
order
of
freemen
there
s
no
town
without
a
lodge
and
where
there
is
a
lodge
i
ll
find
my
friends
the
remark
had
a
singular
effect
upon
his
companion
he
glanced
round
suspiciously
at
the
others
in
the
car
the
miners
were
still
whispering
among
themselves
the
two
police
officers
were
dozing
he
came
across
seated
himself
close
to
the
young
traveller
and
held
out
his
hand
put
it
there
he
said
a
hand
grip
passed
between
the
two
i
see
you
speak
the
truth
said
the
workman
but
it
s
well
to
make
certain
he
raised
his
right
hand
to
his
right
eyebrow
the
traveller
at
once
raised
his
left
hand
to
his
left
eyebrow
dark
nights
are
unpleasant
said
the
workman
yes
for
strangers
to
travel
the
other
answered
that
s
good
enough
i
m
brother
scanlan
lodge
vermissa
valley
glad
to
see
you
in
these
parts
thank
you
i
m
brother
john
mcmurdo
lodge
chicago
bodymaster
j
h
scott
but
i
am
in
luck
to
meet
a
brother
so
early
well
there
are
plenty
of
us
about
you
won
t
find
the
order
more
flourishing
anywhere
in
the
states
than
right
here
in
vermissa
valley
but
we
could
do
with
some
lads
like
you
i
can
t
understand
a
spry
man
of
the
union
finding
no
work
to
do
in
chicago
i
found
plenty
of
work
to
do
said
mcmurdo
then
why
did
you
leave
mcmurdo
nodded
towards
the
policemen
and
smiled
i
guess
those
chaps
would
be
glad
to
know
he
said
scanlan
groaned
sympathetically
in
trouble
he
asked
in
a
whisper
deep
a
penitentiary
job
and
the
rest
not
a
killing
it
s
early
days
to
talk
of
such
things
said
mcmurdo
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
been
surprised
into
saying
more
than
he
intended
i
ve
my
own
good
reasons
for
leaving
chicago
and
let
that
be
enough
for
you
who
are
you
that
you
should
take
it
on
yourself
to
ask
such
things
his
gray
eyes
gleamed
with
sudden
and
dangerous
anger
from
behind
his
glasses
all
right
mate
no
offense
meant
the
boys
will
think
none
the
worse
of
you
whatever
you
may
have
done
where
are
you
bound
for
now
vermissa
that
s
the
third
halt
down
the
line
where
are
you
staying
mcmurdo
took
out
an
envelope
and
held
it
close
to
the
murky
oil
lamp
here
is
the
address
jacob
shafter
sheridan
street
it
s
a
boarding
house
that
was
recommended
by
a
man
i
knew
in
chicago
well
i
don
t
know
it
but
vermissa
is
out
of
my
beat
i
live
at
hobson
s
patch
and
that
s
here
where
we
are
drawing
up
but
say
there
s
one
bit
of
advice
i
ll
give
you
before
we
part
if
you
re
in
trouble
in
vermissa
go
straight
to
the
union
house
and
see
boss
mcginty
he
is
the
bodymaster
of
vermissa
lodge
and
nothing
can
happen
in
these
parts
unless
black
jack
mcginty
wants
it
so
long
mate
maybe
we
ll
meet
in
lodge
one
of
these
evenings
but
mind
my
words
if
you
are
in
trouble
go
to
boss
mcginty
scanlan
descended
and
mcmurdo
was
left
once
again
to
his
thoughts
night
had
now
fallen
and
the
flames
of
the
frequent
furnaces
were
roaring
and
leaping
in
the
darkness
against
their
lurid
background
dark
figures
were
bending
and
straining
twisting
and
turning
with
the
motion
of
winch
or
of
windlass
to
the
rhythm
of
an
eternal
clank
and
roar
i
guess
hell
must
look
something
like
that
said
a
voice
mcmurdo
turned
and
saw
that
one
of
the
policemen
had
shifted
in
his
seat
and
was
staring
out
into
the
fiery
waste
for
that
matter
said
the
other
policeman
i
allow
that
hell
must
be
something
like
that
if
there
are
worse
devils
down
yonder
than
some
we
could
name
it
s
more
than
i
d
expect
i
guess
you
are
new
to
this
part
young
man
well
what
if
i
am
mcmurdo
answered
in
a
surly
voice
just
this
mister
that
i
should
advise
you
to
be
careful
in
choosing
your
friends
i
don
t
think
i
d
begin
with
mike
scanlan
or
his
gang
if
i
were
you
what
the
hell
is
it
to
you
who
are
my
friends
roared
mcmurdo
in
a
voice
which
brought
every
head
in
the
carriage
round
to
witness
the
altercation
did
i
ask
you
for
your
advice
or
did
you
think
me
such
a
sucker
that
i
couldn
t
move
without
it
you
speak
when
you
are
spoken
to
and
by
the
lord
you
d
have
to
wait
a
long
time
if
it
was
me
he
thrust
out
his
face
and
grinned
at
the
patrolmen
like
a
snarling
dog
the
two
policemen
heavy
good
natured
men
were
taken
aback
by
the
extraordinary
vehemence
with
which
their
friendly
advances
had
been
rejected
no
offense
stranger
said

it
was
a
warning
for
your
own
good
seeing
that
you
are
by
your
own
showing
new
to
the
place
i

mcmurdo

cold
fury

when
nobody

it

very
long

one
of
the
patrolmen
with
a
grin

a
real
hand

one
if
i
am
a
judge
i
was
thinking
the
same
remarked
the
other
i
guess

i
m
not
afraid
of
you
and
don
t
you
think
it
cried
mcmurdo
my
name
s
jack
mcmurdo
see
if
you
want
me
you
ll
find
me
at
jacob
shafter
s
on
sheridan
street
vermissa
so
i
m
not
hiding
from
you
am
i
day
or
night
i
dare
to
look
the
like
of
you
in
the
face
don
t
make
any
mistake
about
that
there
was
a
murmur
of
sympathy
and
admiration
from
the
miners
at
the
dauntless
demeanour
of
the
newcomer
while
the
two
policemen
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
renewed
a
conversation
between
themselves
a
few
minutes
later
the
train
ran
into
the
ill
lit
station
and
there
was
a
general
clearing
for
vermissa
was
by
far
the
largest
town
on
the
line
mcmurdo
picked
up
his
leather
gripsack
and
was
about
to
start
off
into
the
darkness
when
one
of
the
miners
accosted
him
by
gar
mate
you
know
how
to
speak
to
the
cops
he
said
in
a
voice
of
awe
it
was
grand
to
hear
you
let
me
carry
your
grip
and
show
you
the
road
i
m
passing
shafter
s
on
the
way
to
my
own
shack
there
was
a
chorus
of
friendly
good
nights
from
the
other
miners
as
they
passed
from
the
platform
before
ever
he
had
set
foot
in
it
mcmurdo
the
turbulent
had
become
a
character
in
vermissa
the
country
had
been
a
place
of
terror
but
the
town
was
in
its
way
even
more
depressing
down
that
long
valley
there
was
at
least
a
certain
gloomy
grandeur
in
the
huge
fires
and
the
clouds
of
drifting
smoke
while
the
strength
and
industry
of
man
found
fitting
monuments
in
the
hills
which
he
had
spilled
by
the
side
of
his
monstrous
excavations
but
the
town
showed
a
dead
level
of
mean
ugliness
and
squalor
the
broad
street
was
churned
up
by
the
traffic
into
a
horrible
rutted
paste
of
muddy
snow
the
sidewalks
were
narrow
and
uneven
the
numerous
gas
lamps
served
only
to
show
more
clearly
a
long
line
of
wooden
houses
each
with
its
veranda
facing
the
street
unkempt
and
dirty
as
they
approached
the
centre
of
the
town
the
scene
was
brightened
by
a
row
of
well
lit
stores
and
even
more
by
a
cluster
of
saloons
and
gaming
houses
in
which
the
miners
spent
their
hard
earned
but
generous
wages
that
s
the
union
house
said
the
guide
pointing
to
one
saloon
which
rose
almost
to
the
dignity
of
being
a
hotel
jack
mcginty
is
the
boss
there
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
mcmurdo
asked
what
have
you
never
heard
of
the
boss
how
could
i
have
heard
of
him
when
you
know
that
i
am
a
stranger
in
these
parts
well
i
thought
his
name
was
known
clear
across
the
country
it
s
been
in
the
papers
often
enough
what
for
well
the
miner
lowered
his
voice
over
the
affairs
what
affairs
good
lord
mister
you
are
queer
if
i
must
say
it
without
offense
there
s
only
one
set
of
affairs
that
you
ll
hear
of
in
these
parts
and
that
s
the
affairs
of
the
scowrers
why
i
seem
to
have
read
of
the
scowrers
in
chicago
a
gang
of
murderers
are
they
not
hush
on
your
life
cried
the
miner
standing
still
in
alarm
and
gazing
in
amazement
at
his
companion
man
you
won
t
live
long
in
these
parts
if
you
speak
in
the
open
street
like
that
many
a
man
has
had
the
life
beaten
out
of
him
for
less
well
i
know
nothing
about
them
it
s
only
what
i
have
read
and
i
m
not
saying
that
you
have
not
read
the
truth
the
man
looked
nervously
round
him
as
he
spoke
peering
into
the
shadows
as
if
he
feared
to
see
some
lurking
danger
if
killing
is
murder
then
god
knows
there
is
murder
and
to
spare
but
don
t
you
dare
to
breathe
the
name
of
jack
mcginty
in
connection
with
it
stranger
for
every
whisper
goes
back
to
him
and
he
is
not
one
that
is
likely
to
let
it
pass
now
that
s
the
house
you
re
after
that
one
standing
back
from
the
street
you
ll
find
old
jacob
shafter
that
runs
it
as
honest
a
man
as
lives
in
this
township
i
thank
you
said
mcmurdo
and
shaking
hands
with
his
new
acquaintance
he
plodded
gripsack
in
hand
up
the
path
which
led
to
the
dwelling
house
at
the
door
of
which
he
gave
a
resounding
knock
it
was
opened
at
once
by
someone
very
different
from
what
he
had
expected
it
was
a
woman
young
and
singularly
beautiful
she
was
of
the
german
type
blonde
and
fair
haired
with
the
piquant
contrast
of
a
pair
of
beautiful
dark
eyes
with
which
she
surveyed
the
stranger
with
surprise
and
a
pleasing
embarrassment
which
brought
a
wave
of
colour
over
her
pale
face
framed
in
the
bright
light
of
the
open
doorway
it
seemed
to
mcmurdo
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
picture
the
more
attractive
for
its
contrast
with
the
sordid
and
gloomy
surroundings
a
lovely
violet
growing
upon
one
of
those
black
slag
heaps
of
the
mines
would
not
have
seemed
more
surprising
so
entranced
was
he
that
he
stood
staring
without
a
word
and
it
was
she
who
broke
the
silence
i
thought
it
was
father
said
she
with
a
pleasing
little
touch
of
a
german
accent
did
you
come
to
see
him
he
is
down
town
i
expect
him
back
every
minute
mcmurdo
continued
to
gaze
at
her
in
open
admiration
until
her
eyes
dropped
in
confusion
before
this
masterful
visitor
no
miss
he
said
at
last
i
m
in
no
hurry
to
see
him
but
your
house
was
recommended
to
me
for
board
i
thought
it
might
suit
me
and
now
i
know
it
will
you
are
quick
to
make
up
your
mind
said
she
with
a
smile
anyone
but
a
blind
man
could
do
as
much
the
other
answered
she
laughed
at
the
compliment
come
right
in
sir
she
said
i
m
miss
ettie
shafter
mr
shafter
s
daughter
my
mother
s
dead
and
i
run
the
house
you
can
sit
down
by
the
stove
in
the
front
room
until
father
comes
along
ah
here
he
is
so
you
can
fix
things
with
him
right
away
a
heavy
elderly
man
came
plodding
up
the
path
in
a
few
words
mcmurdo
explained
his
business
a
man
of
the
name
of
murphy
had
given
him
the
address
in
chicago
he
in
turn
had
had
it
from
someone
else
old
shafter
was
quite
ready
the
stranger
made
no
bones
about
terms
agreed
at
once
to
every
condition
and
was
apparently
fairly
flush
of
money
for
seven
dollars
a
week
paid
in
advance
he
was
to
have
board
and
lodging
so
it
was
that
mcmurdo
the
self
confessed
fugitive
from
justice
took
up
his
abode
under
the
roof
of
the
shafters
the
first
step
which
was
to
lead
to
so
long
and
dark
a
train
of
events
ending
in
a
far
distant
land
chapter
the
bodymaster
mcmurdo
was
a
man
who
made
his
mark
quickly
wherever
he
was
the
folk
around
soon
knew
it
within
a
week
he
had
become
infinitely
the
most
important
person
at
shafter
s
there
were
ten
or
a
dozen
boarders
there
but
they
were
honest
foremen
or
commonplace
clerks
from
the
stores
of
a
very
different
calibre
from
the
young
irishman
of
an
evening
when
they
gathered
together
his
joke
was
always
the
readiest
his
conversation
the
brightest
and
his
song
the
best
he
was
a
born
boon
companion
with
a
magnetism
which
drew
good
humour
from
all
around
him
and
yet
he
showed
again
and
again
as
he
had
shown
in
the
railway
carriage
a
capacity
for
sudden
fierce
anger
which
compelled
the
respect
and
even
the
fear
of
those
who
met
him
for
the
law
too
and
all
who
were
connected
with
it
he
exhibited
a
bitter
contempt
which
delighted
some
and
alarmed
others
of
his
fellow
boarders
from
the
first
he
made
it
evident
by
his
open
admiration
that
the
daughter
of
the
house
had
won
his
heart
from
the
instant
that
he
had
set
eyes
upon
her
beauty
and
her
grace
he
was
no
backward
suitor
on
the
second
day
he
told
her
that
he
loved
her
and
from
then
onward
he
repeated
the
same
story
with
an
absolute
disregard
of
what
she
might
say
to
discourage
him
someone
else
he
would
cry
well
the
worse
luck
for
someone
else
let
him
look
out
for
himself
am
i
to
lose
my
life
s
chance
and
all
my
heart
s
desire
for
someone
else
you
can
keep
on
saying
no
ettie
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
say
yes
and
i
m
young
enough
to
wait
he
was
a
dangerous
suitor
with
his
glib
irish
tongue
and
his
pretty
coaxing
ways
there
was
about
him
also
that
glamour
of
experience
and
of
mystery
which
attracts
a
woman
s
interest
and
finally
her
love
he
could
talk
of
the
sweet
valleys
of
county
monaghan
from
which
he
came
of
the
lovely
distant
island
the
low
hills
and
green
meadows
of
which
seemed
the
more
beautiful
when
imagination
viewed
them
from
this
place
of
grime
and
snow
then
he
was
versed
in
the
life
of
the
cities
of
the
north
of
detroit
and
the
lumber
camps
of
michigan
and
finally
of
chicago
where
he
had
worked
in
a
planing
mill
and
afterwards
came
the
hint
of
romance
the
feeling
that
strange
things
had
happened
to
him
in
that
great
city
so
strange
and
so
intimate
that
they
might
not
be
spoken
of
he
spoke
wistfully
of
a
sudden
leaving
a
breaking
of
old
ties
a
flight
into
a
strange
world
ending
in
this
dreary
valley
and
ettie
listened
her
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
pity
and
with
sympathy
those
two
qualities
which
may
turn
so
rapidly
and
so
naturally
to
love
mcmurdo
had
obtained
a
temporary
job
as
bookkeeper
for
he
was
a
well
educated
man
this
kept
him
out
most
of
the
day
and
he
had
not
found
occasion
yet
to
report
himself
to
the
head
of
the
lodge
of
the
eminent
order
of
freemen
he
was
reminded
of
his
omission
however
by
a
visit
one
evening
from
mike
scanlan
the
fellow
member
whom
he
had
met
in
the
train
scanlan
the
small
sharp
faced
nervous
black
eyed
man
seemed
glad
to
see
him
once
more
after
a
glass
or
two
of
whisky
he
broached
the
object
of
his
visit
say
mcmurdo
said
he
i
remembered
your
address
so
i
made
bold
to
call
i
m
surprised
that
you
ve
not
reported
to
the
bodymaster
why
haven
t
you
seen
boss
mcginty
yet
well
i
had
to
find
a
job
i
have
been
busy
you
must
find
time
for
him
if
you
have
none
for
anything
else
good
lord
man
you
re
a
fool
not
to
have
been
down
to
the
union
house
and
registered
your
name
the
first
morning
after
you
came
here
if
you
run
against
him
well
you
mustn
t
that
s
all
mcmurdo
showed
mild
surprise
i
ve
been
a
member
of
the
lodge
for
over
two
years
scanlan
but
i
never
heard
that
duties
were
so
pressing
as
all
that
maybe
not
in
chicago
well
it
s
the
same
society
here
is
it
scanlan
looked
at
him
long
and
fixedly
there
was
something
sinister
in
his
eyes
isn
t
it
you
ll
tell
me
that
in
a
month
s
time
i
hear
you
had
a
talk
with
the
patrolmen
after
i
left
the
train
how
did
you
know
that
oh
it
got
about
things
do
get
about
for
good
and
for
bad
in
this
district
well
yes
i
told
the
hounds
what
i
thought
of
them
by
the
lord
you
ll
be
a
man
after
mcginty
s
heart
what
does
he
hate
the
police
too
scanlan
burst
out
laughing
you
go
and
see
him
my
lad
said
he
as
he
took
his
leave
it
s
not
the
police
but
you
that
he
ll
hate
if
you
don
t
now
take
a
friend
s
advice
and
go
at
once
it
chanced
that
on
the
same
evening
mcmurdo
had
another
more
pressing
interview
which
urged
him
in
the
same
direction
it
may
have
been
that
his
attentions
to
ettie
had
been
more
evident
than
before
or
that
they
had
gradually
obtruded
themselves
into
the
slow
mind
of
his
good
german
host
but
whatever
the
cause
the
boarding
house
keeper
beckoned
the
young
man
into
his
private
room
and
started
on
the
subject
without
any
circumlocution
it
seems
to
me
mister
said
he
that
you
are
gettin
set
on
my
ettie
ain
t
that
so
or
am
i
wrong
yes
that
is
so
the
young
man
answered
vell
i
vant
to
tell
you
right
now
that
it
ain
t
no
manner
of
use
there
s
someone
slipped
in
afore
you
she
told
me
so
vell
you
can
lay
that
she
told
you
truth
but
did
she
tell
you
who
it
vas
no
i
asked
her
but
she
wouldn
t
tell
i
dare
say
not
the
leetle
baggage
perhaps
she
did
not
vish
to
frighten
you
avay
frighten
mcmurdo
was
on
fire
in
a
moment
ah
yes
my
friend
you
need
not
be
ashamed
to
be
frightened
of
him
it
is
teddy
baldwin
and
who
the
devil
is
he
he
is
a
boss
of
scowrers
scowrers
i
ve
heard
of
them
before
it

scowrers
here
and
scowrers
there
and
always
in
a
whisper
what
are
you
all
afraid
of
who
are
the
scowrers
the
boarding
house
keeper
instinctively
sank
his
voice
as
everyone
did
who
talked
about
that
terrible
society
the
scowrers
said
he
are
the
eminent
order
of
freemen
the
young
man
stared
why
i
am
a
member
of
that
order
myself
you
i
vould
never
have
had
you
in
my
house
if
i
had
known
it
not
if

to

me
a
hundred
dollar
a
veek
what
s
wrong
with
the
order
it
s
for
charity
and
good
fellowship

some
places
not
here
what
is
it
here
it
s
a
murder
society
that
s
vat
it
is
mcmurdo
laughed
incredulously
how

there
not
fifty
murders
to
prove
it
vat
about
milman
and
van
shorst
and

nicholson
family

valley

said
mcmurdo
earnestly

room

place

stranger
in

town

to
a
society
that
i
know
only
as
an
innocent
one
you
ll
find
it
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
states
but
always
as
an
innocent
one
now
when
i
am
counting
upon

it
here

tell
me
that
it
is
the
same
as

me
either
an
apology

from
the
girl

the

hands
i
wish
to
heaven
that

she
sobbed
mcmurdo
was
down
on
his
knees
before
her
in
an
instant
for
god
s
sake
ettie
let
it
stand
at
that
he
cried
will
you
ruin
your
life
and
my
own
for
the
sake
of
this
promise
follow
your
heart
acushla
tis
a
safer
guide
than
any
promise
before
you
knew
what
it
was
that
you
were
saying
he
had
seized
ettie
s
white
hand
between
his
own
strong
brown
ones
say
that
you
will
be
mine
and
we
will
face
it
out
together
not
here
yes
here
no
no
jack
his
arms
were
round
her
now
it
could
not
be
here
could
you
take
me
away
a
struggle
passed
for
a
moment
over
mcmurdo
s
face
but
it
ended
by
setting
like
granite
no
here
he
said
i
ll
hold
you
against
the
world
ettie
right
here
where
we
are
why
should
we
not
leave
together
no
ettie
i
can
t
leave
here
but
why
i
d
never
hold
my
head
up
again
if
i
felt
that
i
had
been
driven
out
besides
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
are
we
not
free
folks
in
a
free
country
if
you
love
me
and
i
you
who
will
dare
to
come
between
you
don
t
know
jack
you
ve
been
here
too
short
a
time
you
don
t
know
this
baldwin
you
don
t
know
mcginty
and
his
scowrers
no
i
don
t
know
them
and
i
don
t
fear
them
and
i
don
t
believe
in
them
said
mcmurdo
i
ve
lived
among
rough
men
my
darling
and
instead
of
fearing
them
it
has
always
ended
that
they
have
feared
me
always
ettie
it
s
mad
on
the
face
of
it
if
these
men
as
your
father
says
have
done
crime
after
crime
in
the
valley
and
if
everyone
knows
them
by
name
how
comes
it
that
none
are
brought
to
justice
you
answer
me
that
ettie
because
no
witness
dares
to
appear
against
them
he
would
not
live
a
month
if
he
did
also
because
they
have
always
their
own
men
to
swear
that
the
accused
one
was
far
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
but
surely
jack
you
must
have
read
all
this
i
had
understood
that
every
paper
in
the
united
states
was
writing
about
it
well
i
have
read
something
it
is
true
but
i
had
thought
it
was
a
story
maybe
these
men
have
some
reason
in
what
they
do
maybe
they
are
wronged
and
have
no
other
way
to
help
themselves
oh
jack
don
t
let
me
hear
you
speak
so
that
is
how
he
speaks
the
other
one
baldwin
he
speaks
like
that
does
he
and
that
is
why
i
loathe
him
so
oh
jack
now
i
can
tell
you
the
truth
i
loathe
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
fear
him
also
i
fear
him
for
myself
but
above
all
i
fear
him
for
father
i
know
that
some
great
sorrow
would
come
upon
us
if
i
dared
to
say
what
i
really
felt
that
is
why
i
have
put
him
off
with
half
promises
it
was
in
real
truth
our
only
hope
but
if
you
would
fly
with
me
jack
we
could
take
father
with
us
and
live
forever
far
from
the
power
of
these
wicked
men
again
there
was
the
struggle
upon
mcmurdo
s
face
and
again
it
set
like
granite
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
ettie
nor
to
your
father
either
as
to
wicked
men
i
expect
you
may
find
that
i
am
as
bad
as
the
worst
of
them
before
we
re
through
no
no
jack
i
would
trust
you
anywhere
mcmurdo
laughed
bitterly
good
lord
how
little
you
know
of
me
your
innocent
soul
my
darling
could
not
even
guess
what
is
passing
in
mine
but
hullo
who
s
the
visitor
the
door
had
opened
suddenly
and
a
young
fellow
came
swaggering
in
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
the
master
he
was
a
handsome
dashing
young
man
of
about
the
same
age
and
build
as
mcmurdo
himself
under
his
broad
brimmed
black
felt
hat
which
he
had
not
troubled
to
remove
a
handsome
face
with
fierce
domineering
eyes
and
a
curved
hawk
bill
of
a
nose
looked
savagely
at
the
pair
who
sat
by
the
stove
ettie
had
jumped
to
her
feet
full
of
confusion
and
alarm
i
m
glad
to
see
you
mr
baldwin
said
she
you
re
earlier
than
i
had
thought
come
and
sit
down
baldwin
stood
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
looking
at
mcmurdo
who
is
this
he
asked
curtly
it
s
a
friend
of
mine
mr
baldwin
a
new
boarder
here
mr
mcmurdo
may
i
introduce
you
to
mr
baldwin
the
young
men
nodded
in
surly
fashion
to
each
other
maybe
miss
ettie
has
told
you
how
it
is
with
us
said
baldwin
i
didn
t
understand
that
there
was
any
relation
between
you
didn
t
you
well
you
can
understand
it
now
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
this
young
lady
is
mine
and
you
ll
find
it
a
very
fine
evening
for
a
walk
thank
you
i
am
in
no
humour
for
a
walk
aren
t
you
the
man
s
savage
eyes
were
blazing
with
anger
maybe
you
are
in
a
humour
for
a
fight
mr
boarder
that
i
am
cried
mcmurdo
springing
to
his
feet
you
never
said
a
more
welcome
word
for
god

sake
cried
poor
distracted
ettie
oh

an
oath

reasonable

kind
for
my
sake
ted
if

big
hearted
and
forgiving
i
think
ettie
that
if
you
were
to
leave
us
alone
we
could
get
this
thing
settled
said
mcmurdo
quietly
or
maybe
mr
baldwin
you
will
take
a
turn
down
the
street
with
me
it
s
a
fine
evening
and
there
s
some
open
ground
beyond
the
next
block
i
ll
get
even
with
you
without
needing
to
dirty
my
hands
said
his
enemy
you
ll
wish
you
had
never
set
foot
in
this
house
before
i
am
through
with
you
no
time
like
the
present
cried
mcmurdo
i
ll
choose
my
own
time
mister
you
can
leave
the
time
to
me
see
here
he
suddenly
rolled
up
his
sleeve
and
showed
upon
his
forearm
a
peculiar
sign
which
appeared
to
have
been
branded
there
it
was
a
circle
with
a
triangle
within
it
d
you
know
what
that
means
i
neither
know
nor
care
well
you
will
know
i
ll
promise
you
that
you
won
t
be
much
older
either
perhaps
miss
ettie
can
tell
you
something
about
it
as
to
you
ettie
you
ll
come
back
to
me
on
your
knees
d
ye
hear
girl
on
your
knees
and
then
i
ll
tell
you
what
your
punishment
may
be
you
ve
sowed
and
by
the
lord
i
ll
see
that
you
reap
he
glanced
at
them
both
in
fury
then
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
an
instant
later
the
outer
door
had
banged
behind
him
for
a
few
moments
mcmurdo
and
the
girl
stood
in
silence
then
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
oh
jack
how
brave
you
were
but
it
is
no
use
you
must
fly
to
night
jack
to
night
it
s
your
only
hope
he
will
have
your
life
i
read
it
in
his
horrible
eyes
what
chance
have
you
against
a
dozen
of
them
with
boss
mcginty
and
all
the
power
of
the
lodge
behind
them
mcmurdo
disengaged
her
hands
kissed
her
and
gently
pushed
her
back
into
a
chair
there
acushla
there
don
t
be
disturbed
or
fear
for
me
i
m
a
freeman
myself
i
m
after
telling
your
father
about
it
maybe
i
am
no
better
than
the
others
so
don
t
make
a
saint
of
me
perhaps
you
hate
me
too
now
that
i
ve
told
you
as
much
hate
you
jack
while
life
lasts
i
could
never
do
that
i
ve
heard
that
there
is
no
harm
in
being
a
freeman
anywhere
but
here
so
why
should
i
think
the
worse
of
you
for
that
but
if
you
are
a
freeman
jack
why
should
you
not
go
down
and
make
a
friend
of
boss
mcginty
oh
hurry
jack
hurry
get
your
word
in
first
or
the
hounds
will
be
on
your
trail
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
said
mcmurdo
i
ll
go
right
now
and
fix
it
you
can
tell
your
father
that
i
ll
sleep
here
to
night
and
find
some
other
quarters
in
the
morning
the
bar
of
mcginty
s
saloon
was
crowded
as
usual
for
it
was
the
favourite
loafing
place
of
all
the
rougher
elements
of
the
town
the
man
was
popular
for
he
had
a
rough
jovial
disposition
which
formed
a
mask
covering
a
great
deal
which
lay
behind
it
but
apart
from
this
popularity
the
fear
in
which
he
was
held
throughout
the
township
and
indeed
down
the
whole
thirty
miles
of
the
valley
and
past
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
it
was
enough
in
itself
to
fill
his
bar
for
none
could
afford
to
neglect
his
good
will
besides
those
secret
powers
which
it
was
universally
believed
that
he
exercised
in
so
pitiless
a
fashion
he
was
a
high
public
official
a
municipal
councillor
and
a
commissioner
of
roads
elected
to
the
office
through
the
votes
of
the
ruffians
who
in
turn
expected
to
receive
favours
at
his
hands
assessments
and
taxes
were
enormous
the
public
works
were
notoriously
neglected
the
accounts
were
slurred
over
by
bribed
auditors
and
the
decent
citizen
was
terrorized
into
paying
public
blackmail
and
holding
his
tongue
lest
some
worse
thing
befall
him
thus
it
was
that
year
by
year
boss
mcginty
s
diamond
pins
became
more
obtrusive
his
gold
chains
more
weighty
across
a
more
gorgeous
vest
and
his
saloon
stretched
farther
and
farther
until
it
threatened
to
absorb
one
whole
side
of
the
market
square
mcmurdo
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
of
the
saloon
and
made
his
way
amid
the
crowd
of
men
within
through
an
atmosphere
blurred
with
tobacco
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
spirits
the
place
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
huge
heavily
gilt
mirrors
upon
every
wall
reflected
and
multiplied
the
garish
illumination
there
were
several
bartenders
in
their
shirt
sleeves
hard
at
work
mixing
drinks
for
the
loungers
who
fringed
the
broad
brass
trimmed
counter
at
the
far
end
with
his
body
resting
upon
the
bar
and
a
cigar
stuck
at
an
acute
angle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
stood
a
tall
strong
heavily
built
man
who
could
be
none
other
than
the
famous
mcginty
himself
he
was
a
black
maned
giant
bearded
to
the
cheek
bones
and
with
a
shock
of
raven
hair
which
fell
to
his
collar
his
complexion
was
as
swarthy
as
that
of
an
italian
and
his
eyes
were
of
a
strange
dead
black
which
combined
with
a
slight
squint
gave
them
a
particularly
sinister
appearance
all
else
in
the
man
his
noble
proportions
his
fine
features
and
his
frank
bearing
fitted
in
with
that
jovial
man
to
man
manner
which
he
affected
here
one
would
say
is
a
bluff
honest
fellow
whose
heart
would
be
sound
however
rude
his
outspoken
words
might
seem
it
was
only
when
those
dead
dark
eyes
deep
and
remorseless
were
turned
upon
a
man
that
he
shrank
within
himself
feeling
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
an
infinite
possibility
of
latent
evil
with
a
strength
and
courage
and
cunning
behind
it
which
made
it
a
thousand
times
more
deadly
having
had
a
good
look
at
his
man
mcmurdo
elbowed
his
way
forward
with
his
usual
careless
audacity
and
pushed
himself
through
the
little
group
of
courtiers
who
were
fawning
upon
the
powerful
boss
laughing
uproariously
at
the
smallest
of
his
jokes
the
young
stranger
s
bold
gray
eyes
looked
back
fearlessly
through
their
glasses
at
the
deadly
black
ones
which
turned
sharply
upon
him
well
young
man
i
can
t
call
your
face
to
mind
i
m
new
here
mr
mcginty
you
are
not
so
new
that
you
can
t
give
a
gentleman
his
proper
title
he
s
councillor
mcginty
young
man
said
a
voice
from
the
group
i
m
sorry
councillor
i
m
strange
to
the
ways
of
the
place
but
i
was
advised
to
see
you
well
you
see
me
this
is
all
there
is
what
d
you
think
of
me
well
it
s
early
days
if
your
heart
is
as
big
as
your
body
and
your
soul
as
fine
as
your
face
then
i
d
ask
for
nothing
better
said
mcmurdo
by
gar
you
ve
got
an
irish
tongue
in
your
head
anyhow
cried
the
saloon
keeper
not
quite
certain
whether
to
humour
this
audacious
visitor
or
to
stand
upon
his
dignity
so
you
are
good
enough
to
pass
my
appearance
sure
said
mcmurdo
and
you
were
told
to
see
me
i
was
and
who
told
you
brother
scanlan
of
lodge
vermissa
i
drink
your
health
councillor
and
to
our
better
acquaintance
he
raised
a
glass
with
which
he
had
been
served
to
his
lips
and
elevated
his
little
finger
as
he
drank
it
mcginty
who
had
been
watching
him
narrowly
raised
his
thick
black
eyebrows
oh
it
s
like
that
is
it
said
he
i
ll
have
to
look
a
bit
closer
into
this
mister
mcmurdo
a
bit
closer
mr
mcmurdo
for
we
don
t
take
folk
on
trust
in
these
parts
nor
believe
all
we
re
told
neither
come
in
here
for
a
moment
behind
the
bar
there
was
a
small
room
there
lined
with
barrels
mcginty
carefully
closed
the
door
and
then
seated
himself
on
one
of
them
biting
thoughtfully
on
his
cigar
and
surveying
his
companion
with
those
disquieting
eyes
for
a
couple
of
minutes
he
sat
in
complete
silence
mcmurdo
bore
the
inspection
cheerfully
one
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
the
other
twisting
his
brown
moustache
suddenly
mcginty
stooped
and
produced
a
wicked
looking
revolver
see
here
my
joker
said
he
if
i
thought
you
were
playing
any
game
on
us
it
would
be
short
work
for
you
this
is
a
strange
welcome
mcmurdo
answered
with
some
dignity
for
the
bodymaster
of
a
lodge
of
freemen
to
give
to
a
stranger
brother
ay
but
it
s
just
that
same
that
you
have
to
prove
said
mcginty
and
god
help
you
if
you
fail
where
were
you
made
lodge
chicago
when
june
what
bodymaster
james
h
scott
who
is
your
district
ruler
bartholomew
wilson
hum
you
seem
glib
enough
in
your
tests
what
are
you
doing
here
working
the
same
as
you
but
a
poorer
job
you
have
your
back
answer
quick
enough
yes
i
was
always
quick
of
speech
are
you
quick
of
action
i
have
had
that
name
among
those
that
knew
me
best
well
we
may
try
you
sooner
than
you
think
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
lodge
in
these
parts
i
ve
heard
that
it
takes
a
man
to
be
a
brother
true
for
you
mr
mcmurdo
why
did
you
leave
chicago
i
m
damned
if
i
tell
you
that
mcginty
opened
his
eyes
he
was
not
used
to
being
answered
in
such
fashion
and
it
amused
him
why
won
t
you
tell
me
because
no
brother
may
tell
another
a
lie
then
the
truth
is
too
bad
to
tell
you
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
see
here
mister
you
can
t
expect
me
as
bodymaster
to
pass
into
the
lodge
a
man
for
whose
past
he
can
t
answer
mcmurdo
looked
puzzled
then
he
took
a
worn
newspaper
cutting
from
an
inner
pocket
you
wouldn
t
squeal
on
a
fellow
said
he
i
ll
wipe
my
hand
across
your
face
if
you
say
such
words
to
me
cried
mcginty
hotly
you
are
right
councillor
said
mcmurdo
meekly
i
should
apologize
i
spoke
without
thought
well
i
know
that
i
am
safe
in
your
hands
look
at
that
clipping
mcginty
glanced
his
eyes
over
the
account
of
the
shooting
of
one
jonas
pinto
in
the
lake
saloon
market
street
chicago
in
the
new
year
week
of
your
work
he
asked
as
he
handed
back
the
paper
mcmurdo
nodded
why
did
you
shoot
him
i
was
helping
uncle
sam
to
make
dollars
maybe
mine
were
not
as
good
gold
as
his
but
they
looked
as
well
and
were
cheaper
to
make
this
man
pinto
helped
me
to
shove
the
queer
to
do
what
well
it
means
to
pass
the
dollars
out
into
circulation
then
he
said
he
would
split
maybe
he
did
split
i
didn
t
wait
to
see
i
just
killed
him
and
lighted
out
for
the
coal
country
why
the
coal
country
cause
i
d
read
in
the
papers
that
they
weren
t
too
particular
in
those
parts
mcginty
laughed
you
were
first
a
coiner
and
then
a
murderer
and
you
came
to
these
parts
because
you
thought
you
d
be
welcome
that
s
about
the
size
of
it
mcmurdo
answered
well
i
guess
you
ll
go
far
say
can
you
make
those
dollars
yet
mcmurdo
took
half
a
dozen
from
his
pocket
those
never
passed
the
philadelphia
mint
said
he
you
don
t
say
mcginty
held
them
to
the
light
in
his
enormous
hand
which
was
hairy
as
a
gorilla
s
i
can
see
no
difference
gar
you
ll
be
a
mighty
useful
brother
i
m
thinking
we
can
do
with
a
bad
man
or
two
among
us
friend
mcmurdo
for
there
are
times
when
we
have
to
take
our
own
part
we
d
soon
be
against
the
wall
if
we
didn
t
shove
back
at
those
that
were
pushing
us
well
i
guess
i
ll
do
my
share
of
shoving
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
you
seem
to
have
a
good
nerve
you
didn
t
squirm
when
i
shoved
this
gun
at
you
it
was
not
me
that
was
in
danger
who
then
it
was
you
councillor
mcmurdo
drew
a
cocked
pistol
from
the
side
pocket
of
his
peajacket
i
was
covering
you
all
the
time
i
guess
my
shot
would
have
been
as
quick
as
yours
by
gar
mcginty
flushed
an
angry
red
and
then
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
say
we
ve
had
no
such
holy
terror
come
to
hand
this
many
a
year
i
reckon
the
lodge
will
learn
to
be
proud
of
you
well
what
the
hell
do
you
want
and
can
t
i
speak
alone
with
a
gentleman
for
five
minutes
but
you
must
butt
in
on
us
the
bartender
stood
abashed
i
m
sorry
councillor
but
it
s
ted
baldwin
he
says
he
must
see
you
this
very
minute
the
message
was
unnecessary
for
the
set
cruel
face
of
the
man
himself
was
looking
over
the
servant
s
shoulder
he
pushed
the
bartender
out
and
closed
the
door
on
him
so
said
he
with
a
furious
glance
at
mcmurdo
you
got
here
first
did
you
i
ve
a
word
to
say
to
you
councillor
about
this
man
then
say
it
here
and
now
before
my
face
cried
mcmurdo
i
ll
say
it
at
my
own
time
in
my
own
way
tut
tut
said
mcginty
getting
off
his
barrel
this
will
never
do
we
have
a
new
brother
here
baldwin
and
it
s
not
for
us
to
greet
him
in
such
fashion
hold
out
your
hand
man
and
make
it
up
never
cried
baldwin
in
a
fury
i
ve
offered
to
fight
him
if
he
thinks
i
have
wronged
him
said
mcmurdo
i
ll
fight
him
with
fists
or
if
that
won
t
satisfy
him
i
ll
fight
him
any
other
way
he
chooses
now
i
ll
leave
it
to
you
councillor
to
judge
between
us
as
a
bodymaster
should
what
is
it
then
a
young
lady
she
s
free
to
choose
for
herself
is
she
cried
baldwin
as
between
two
brothers
of
the
lodge
i
should
say
that
she
was
said
the
boss
oh
that
s
your
ruling
is
it
yes
it
is
ted
baldwin
said
mcginty
with
a
wicked
stare
is
it
you
that
would
dispute
it
you
would
throw
over
one
that
has
stood
by
you
this
five
years
in
favour
of
a
man
that
you
never
saw
before
in
your
life
you
re
not
bodymaster
for
life
jack
mcginty
and
by
god
when
next
it
comes
to
a
vote
the
councillor
sprang
at
him
like
a
tiger
his
hand
closed
round
the
other
s
neck
and
he
hurled
him
back
across
one
of
the
barrels
in
his
mad
fury
he
would
have
squeezed
the
life
out
of
him
if
mcmurdo
had
not
interfered
easy
councillor
for
heaven
s
sake
go
easy
he
cried
as
he
dragged
him
back
mcginty
released
his
hold
and
baldwin
cowed
and
shaken
gasping
for
breath
and
shivering
in
every
limb
as
one
who
has
looked
over
the
very
edge
of
death
sat
up
on
the
barrel
over
which
he
had
been
hurled
you
ve
been
asking
for
it
this
many
a
day
ted
baldwin
now
you
ve
got
it
cried
mcginty
his
huge
chest
rising
and
falling
maybe
you
think
if
i
was
voted
down
from
bodymaster
you
would
find
yourself
in
my
shoes
it
s
for
the
lodge
to
say
that
but
so
long
as
i
am
the
chief
i
ll
have
no
man
lift
his
voice
against
me
or
my
rulings
i
have
nothing
against
you
mumbled
baldwin
feeling
his
throat
well
then
cried
the
other
relapsing
in
a
moment
into
a
bluff
joviality
we
are
all
good
friends
again
and
there
s
an
end
of
the
matter
he
took
a
bottle
of
champagne
down
from
the
shelf
and
twisted
out
the
cork
see
now
he
continued
as
he
filled
three
high
glasses
let
us
drink
the
quarrelling
toast
of
the
lodge
after
that
as
you
know
there
can
be
no
bad
blood
between
us
now
then
the
left
hand
on
the
apple
of
my
throat
i
say
to
you
ted
baldwin
what
is
the
offense
sir
the
clouds
are
heavy
answered
baldwin
but
they
will
forever
brighten
and
this
i
swear
the
men
drank
their
glasses
and
the
same
ceremony
was
performed
between
baldwin
and
mcmurdo
there
cried
mcginty
rubbing
his
hands
that
s
the
end
of
the
black
blood
you
come
under
lodge
discipline
if
it
goes
further
and
that
s
a
heavy
hand
in
these
parts
as
brother
baldwin
knows
and
as
you
will
damn
soon
find
out
brother
mcmurdo
if
you
ask
for
trouble
faith
i
d
be
slow
to
do
that
said
mcmurdo
he
held
out
his
hand
to
baldwin
i
m
quick
to
quarrel
and
quick
to
forgive
it
s
my
hot
irish
blood
they
tell
me
but
it
s
over
for
me
and
i
bear
no
grudge
baldwin
had
to
take
the
proffered
hand
for
the
baleful
eye
of
the
terrible
boss
was
upon
him
but
his
sullen
face
showed
how
little
the
words
of
the
other
had
moved
him
mcginty
clapped
them
both
on
the
shoulders
tut
these
girls
these
girls
he
cried
to
think
that
the
same
petticoats
should
come
between
two
of
my
boys
it
s
the
devil
s
own
luck
well
it
s
the
colleen
inside
of
them
that
must
settle
the
question
for
it
s
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
a
bodymaster
and
the
lord
be
praised
for
that
we
have
enough
on
us
without
the
women
as
well
you
ll
have
to
be
affiliated
to
lodge
brother
mcmurdo
we
have
our
own
ways
and
methods
different
from
chicago
saturday
night
is
our
meeting
and
if
you
come
then
we
ll
make
you
free
forever
of
the
vermissa
valley
chapter
lodge
vermissa
on
the
day
following
the
evening
which
had
contained
so
many
exciting
events
mcmurdo
moved
his
lodgings
from
old
jacob
shafter
s
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
the
widow
macnamara
s
on
the
extreme
outskirts
of
the
town
scanlan
his
original
acquaintance
aboard
the
train
had
occasion
shortly
afterwards
to
move
into
vermissa
and
the
two
lodged
together
there
was
no
other
boarder
and
the
hostess
was
an
easy
going
old
irishwoman
who
left
them
to
themselves
so
that
they
had
a
freedom
for
speech
and
action
welcome
to
men
who
had
secrets
in
common
shafter
had
relented
to
the
extent
of
letting
mcmurdo
come
to
his
meals
there
when
he
liked
so
that
his
intercourse
with
ettie
was
by
no
means
broken
on
the
contrary
it
drew
closer
and
more
intimate
as
the
weeks
went
by
in
his
bedroom
at
his
new
abode
mcmurdo
felt
it
safe
to
take
out
the
coining
moulds
and
under
many
a
pledge
of
secrecy
a
number
of
brothers
from
the
lodge
were
allowed
to
come
in
and
see
them
each
carrying
away
in
his
pocket
some
examples
of
the
false
money
so
cunningly
struck
that
there
was
never
the
slightest
difficulty
or
danger
in
passing
it
why
with
such
a
wonderful
art
at
his
command
mcmurdo
should
condescend
to
work
at
all
was
a
perpetual
mystery
to
his
companions
though
he
made
it
clear
to
anyone
who
asked
him
that
if
he
lived
without
any
visible
means
it
would
very
quickly
bring
the
police
upon
his
track
one
policeman
was
indeed
after
him
already
but
the
incident
as
luck
would
have
it
did
the
adventurer
a
great
deal
more
good
than
harm
after
the
first
introduction
there
were
few
evenings
when
he
did
not
find
his
way
to
mcginty
s
saloon
there
to
make
closer
acquaintance
with
the
boys
which
was
the
jovial
title
by
which
the
dangerous
gang
who
infested
the
place
were
known
to
one
another
his
dashing
manner
and
fearlessness
of
speech
made
him
a
favourite
with
them
all
while
the
rapid
and
scientific
way
in
which
he
polished
off
his
antagonist
in
an
all
in
bar
room
scrap
earned
the
respect
of
that
rough
community
another
incident
however
raised
him
even
higher
in
their
estimation
just
at
the
crowded
hour
one
night
the
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
with
the
quiet
blue
uniform
and
peaked
cap
of
the
mine
police
this
was
a
special
body
raised
by
the
railways
and
colliery
owners
to
supplement
the
efforts
of
the
ordinary
civil
police
who
were
perfectly
helpless
in
the
face
of
the
organized
ruffianism
which
terrorized
the
district
there
was
a
hush
as
he
entered
and
many
a
curious
glance
was
cast
at
him
but
the
relations
between
policemen
and
criminals
are
peculiar
in
some
parts
of
the
states
and
mcginty
himself
standing
behind
his
counter
showed
no
surprise
when
the
policeman
enrolled
himself
among
his
customers
a
straight
whisky
for
the
night
is
bitter
said
the
police
officer
i
don
t
think
we
have
met
before
councillor
you
ll
be
the
new
captain
said
mcginty
that
s
so
we
re
looking
to
you
councillor
and
to
the
other
leading
citizens
to
help
us
in
upholding
law
and
order
in
this
township
captain
marvin
is
my
name
we
d
do
better
without
you
captain
marvin
said
mcginty
coldly
for
we
have
our
own
police
of
the
township
and
no
need
for
any
imported
goods
what
are
you
but
the
paid
tool
of
the
capitalists
hired
by
them
to
club
or
shoot
your
poorer
fellow
citizen
well
well
we
won
t
argue
about
that
said
the
police
officer
good
humouredly
i
expect
we
all
do
our
duty
same
as
we
see
it
but
we
can
t
all
see
it
the
same
he
had
drunk
off
his
glass
and
had
turned
to
go
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
face
of
jack
mcmurdo
who
was
scowling
at
his
elbow
hullo
hullo
he
cried
looking
him
up
and
down
here
s
an
old
acquaintance
mcmurdo
shrank
away
from
him
i
was
never
a
friend
to
you
nor
any
other
cursed
copper
in
my
life
said
he
an
acquaintance
isn
t
always
a
friend
said
the
police
captain
grinning
you
re
jack
mcmurdo
of
chicago
right
enough
and
don
t
you
deny
it
mcmurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
m
not
denying
it
said
he
d
ye
think
i
m
ashamed
of
my
own
name
you
ve
got
good
cause
to
be
anyhow
what
the
devil
d
you
mean
by
that
he
roared
with
his
fists
clenched
no
no
jack
bluster
won
t
do
with
me
i
was
an
officer
in
chicago
before
ever
i
came
to
this
darned
coal
bunker
and
i
know
a
chicago
crook
when
i
see
one
mcmurdo
s
face
fell
don
t
tell
me
that
you
re
marvin
of
the
chicago
central
he
cried
just
the
same
old
teddy
marvin
at
your
service
we
haven
t
forgotten
the
shooting
of
jonas
pinto
up
there
i
never
shot
him
did
you
not
that
s
good
impartial
evidence
ain
t
it
well
his
death
came
in
uncommon
handy
for
you
or
they
would
have
had
you
for
shoving
the
queer
well
we
can
let
that
be
bygones
for
between
you
and
me
and
perhaps
i
m
going
further
than
my
duty
in
saying
it
they
could
get
no
clear
case
against
you
and
chicago
s
open
to
you
to
morrow
i
m
very
well
where
i
am
well
i
ve
given
you
the
pointer
and
you
re
a
sulky
dog
not
to
thank
me
for
it
well
i
suppose
you
mean
well
and
i
do
thank
you
said
mcmurdo
in
no
very
gracious
manner
it
s
mum
with
me
so
long
as
i
see
you
living
on
the
straight
said
the
captain
but
by
the
lord
if
you
get
off
after
this
it
s
another
story
so
good
night
to
you
and
good
night
councillor
he
left
the
bar
room
but
not
before
he
had
created
a
local
hero
mcmurdo
s
deeds
in
far
chicago
had
been
whispered
before
he
had
put
off
all
questions
with
a
smile
as
one
who
did
not
wish
to
have
greatness
thrust
upon
him
but
now
the
thing
was
officially
confirmed
the
bar
loafers
crowded
round
him
and
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
he
was
free
of
the
community
from
that
time
on
he
could
drink
hard
and
show
little
trace
of
it
but
that
evening
had
his
mate
scanlan
not
been
at
hand
to
lead
him
home
the
feted
hero
would
surely
have
spent
his
night
under
the
bar
on
a
saturday
night
mcmurdo
was
introduced
to
the
lodge
he
had
thought
to
pass
in
without
ceremony
as
being
an
initiate
of
chicago
but
there
were
particular
rites
in
vermissa
of
which
they
were
proud
and
these
had
to
be
undergone
by
every
postulant
the
assembly
met
in
a
large
room
reserved
for
such
purposes
at
the
union
house
some
sixty
members
assembled
at
vermissa
but
that
by
no
means
represented
the
full
strength
of
the
organization
for
there
were
several
other
lodges
in
the
valley
and
others
across
the
mountains
on
each
side
who
exchanged
members
when
any
serious
business
was
afoot
so
that
a
crime
might
be
done
by
men
who
were
strangers
to
the
locality
altogether
there
were
not
less
than
five
hundred
scattered
over
the
coal
district
in
the
bare
assembly
room
the
men
were
gathered
round
a
long
table
at
the
side
was
a
second
one
laden
with
bottles
and
glasses
on
which
some
members
of
the
company
were
already
turning
their
eyes
mcginty
sat
at
the
head
with
a
flat
black
velvet
cap
upon
his
shock
of
tangled
black
hair
and
a
coloured
purple
stole
round
his
neck
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
priest
presiding
over
some
diabolical
ritual
to
right
and
left
of
him
were
the
higher
lodge
officials
the
cruel
handsome
face
of
ted
baldwin
among
them
each
of
these
wore
some
scarf
or
medallion
as
emblem
of
his
office
they
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
mature
age
but
the
rest
of
the
company
consisted
of
young
fellows
from
eighteen
to
twenty
five
the
ready
and
capable
agents
who
carried
out
the
commands
of
their
seniors
among
the
older
men
were
many
whose
features
showed
the
tigerish
lawless
souls
within
but
looking
at
the
rank
and
file
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
these
eager
and
open
faced
young
fellows
were
in
very
truth
a
dangerous
gang
of
murderers
whose
minds
had
suffered
such
complete
moral
perversion
that
they
took
a
horrible
pride
in
their
proficiency
at
the
business
and
looked
with
deepest
respect
at
the
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
making
what
they
called
a
clean
job
to
their
contorted
natures
it
had
become
a
spirited
and
chivalrous
thing
to
volunteer
for
service
against
some
man
who
had
never
injured
them
and
whom
in
many
cases
they
had
never
seen
in
their
lives
the
crime
committed
they
quarrelled
as
to
who
had
actually
struck
the
fatal
blow
and
amused
one
another
and
the
company
by
describing
the
cries
and
contortions
of
the
murdered
man
at
first
they
had
shown
some
secrecy
in
their
arrangements
but
at
the
time
which
this
narrative
describes
their
proceedings
were
extraordinarily
open
for
the
repeated
failure
of
the
law
had
proved
to
them
that
on
the
one
hand
no
one
would
dare
to
witness
against
them
and
on
the
other
they
had
an
unlimited
number
of
stanch
witnesses
upon
whom
they
could
call
and
a
well
filled
treasure
chest
from
which
they
could
draw
the
funds
to
engage
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
state
in
ten
long
years
of
outrage
there
had
been
no
single
conviction
and
the
only
danger
that
ever
threatened
the
scowrers
lay
in
the
victim
himself
who
however
outnumbered
and
taken
by
surprise
might
and
occasionally
did
leave
his
mark
upon
his
assailants
mcmurdo
had
been
warned
that
some
ordeal
lay
before
him
but
no
one
would
tell
him
in
what
it
consisted
he
was
led
now
into
an
outer
room
by
two
solemn
brothers
through
the
plank
partition
he
could
hear
the
murmur
of
many
voices
from
the
assembly
within
once
or
twice
he
caught
the
sound
of
his
own
name
and
he
knew
that
they
were
discussing
his
candidacy
then
there
entered
an
inner
guard
with
a
green
and
gold
sash
across
his
chest
the
bodymaster
orders
that
he
shall
be
trussed
blinded
and
entered
said
he
the
three
of
them
removed
his
coat
turned
up
the
sleeve
of
his
right
arm
and
finally
passed
a
rope
round
above
the
elbows
and
made
it
fast
they
next
placed
a
thick
black
cap
right
over
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
face
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
he
was
then
led
into
the
assembly
hall
it
was
pitch
dark
and
very
oppressive
under
his
hood
he
heard
the
rustle
and
murmur
of
the
people
round
him
and
then
the
voice
of
mcginty
sounded
dull
and
distant
through
the
covering
of
his
ears
john
mcmurdo
said
the
voice
are
you
already
a
member
of
the
ancient
order
of
freemen
he
bowed
in
assent
is
your
lodge
no
chicago
he
bowed
again
dark
nights
are
unpleasant
said
the
voice
yes
for
strangers
to
travel
he
answered
the
clouds
are
heavy
yes
a
storm
is
approaching
are
the
brethren
satisfied
asked
the
bodymaster
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
assent
we
know
brother
by
your
sign
and
by
your
countersign
that
you
are
indeed
one
of
us
said
mcginty
we
would
have
you
know
however
that
in
this
county
and
in
other
counties
of
these
parts
we
have
certain
rites
and
also
certain
duties
of
our
own
which
call
for
good
men
are
you
ready
to
be
tested
i
am
are
you
of
stout
heart
i
am
take
a
stride
forward
to
prove
it
as
the
words
were
said
he
felt
two
hard
points
in
front
of
his
eyes
pressing
upon
them
so
that
it
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
move
forward
without
a
danger
of
losing
them
none
the
less
he
nerved
himself
to
step
resolutely
out
and
as
he
did
so
the
pressure
melted
away
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
applause
he
is
of
stout
heart
said
the
voice
can
you
bear
pain
as
well
as
another
he
answered
test
him
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
screaming
out
for
an
agonizing
pain
shot
through
his
forearm
he
nearly
fainted
at
the
sudden
shock
of
it
but
he
bit
his
lip
and
clenched
his
hands
to
hide
his
agony
i
can
take
more
than
that
said
he
this
time
there
was
loud
applause
a
finer
first
appearance
had
never
been
made
in
the
lodge
hands
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
the
hood
was
plucked
from
his
head
he
stood
blinking
and
smiling
amid
the
congratulations
of
the
brothers
one
last
word
brother
mcmurdo
said
mcginty
you
have
already
sworn
the
oath
of
secrecy
and
fidelity
and
you
are
aware
that
the
punishment
for
any
breach
of
it
is
instant
and
inevitable
death
i
am
said
mcmurdo
and
you
accept
the
rule
of
the
bodymaster
for
the
time
being
under
all
circumstances
i
do
then
in
the
name
of
lodge
vermissa
i
welcome
you
to
its
privileges
and
debates
you
will
put
the
liquor
on
the
table
brother
scanlan
and
we
will
drink
to
our
worthy
brother
mcmurdo
s
coat
had
been
brought
to
him
but
before
putting
it
on
he
examined
his
right
arm
which
still
smarted
heavily
there
on
the
flesh
of
the
forearm
was
a
circle
with
a
triangle
within
it
deep
and
red
as
the
branding
iron
had
left
it
one
or
two
of
his
neighbours
pulled
up
their
sleeves
and
showed
their
own
lodge
marks
we
ve
all
had
it
said
one
but
not
all
as
brave
as
you
over
it
tut
it
was
nothing
said
he
but
it
burned
and
ached
all
the
same
when
the
drinks
which
followed
the
ceremony
of
initiation
had
all
been
disposed
of
the
business
of
the
lodge
proceeded
mcmurdo
accustomed
only
to
the
prosaic
performances
of
chicago
listened
with
open
ears
and
more
surprise
than
he
ventured
to
show
to
what
followed
the
first
business
on
the
agenda
paper
said
mcginty
is
to
read
the
following
letter
from
division
master
windle
of
merton
county
lodge
he
says
dear
sir
there
is
a
job
to
be
done
on
andrew
rae
of
rae
sturmash
coal
owners
near
this
place
you
will
remember
that
your
lodge
owes
us
a
return
having
had
the
service
of
two
brethren
in
the
matter
of
the
patrolman
last
fall
you
will
send
two
good
men
they
will
be
taken
charge
of
by
treasurer
higgins
of
this
lodge
whose
address
you
know
he
will
show
them
when
to
act
and
where
yours
in
freedom
j
w
windle
d
m
a
o
f
windle
has
never
refused
us
when
we
have
had
occasion
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
a
man
or
two
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
refuse
him
mcginty
paused
and
looked
round
the
room
with
his
dull
malevolent
eyes
who
will
volunteer
for
the
job
several
young
fellows
held
up
their
hands
the
bodymaster
looked
at
them
with
an
approving
smile
you
ll
do
tiger
cormac
if
you
handle
it
as
well
as
you
did
the
last
you
won
t
be
wrong
and
you
wilson
i
ve
no
pistol
said
the
volunteer
a
mere
boy
in
his
teens
it
s
your
first
is
it
not
well
you
have
to
be
blooded
some
time
it
will
be
a
great
start
for
you
as
to
the
pistol
you
ll
find
it
waiting
for
you
or
i
m
mistaken
if
you
report
yourselves
on
monday
it
will
be
time
enough
you
ll
get
a
great
welcome
when
you
return
any
reward
this
time
asked
cormac
a
thick
set
dark
faced
brutal
looking
young
man
whose
ferocity
had
earned
him
the
nickname
of
tiger
never
mind
the
reward
you
just
do
it
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
maybe
when
it
is
done
there
will
be
a
few
odd
dollars
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
what
has
the
man
done
asked
young
wilson
sure
it
s
not
for
the
likes
of
you
to
ask
what
the
man
has
done
he
has
been
judged
over
there
that
s
no
business
of
ours
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
carry
it
out
for
them
same
as
they
would
for
us
speaking
of
that
two
brothers
from
the
merton
lodge
are
coming
over
to
us
next
week
to
do
some
business
in
this
quarter
who
are
they
asked
someone
faith
it
is
wiser
not
to
ask
if
you
know
nothing
you
can
testify
nothing
and
no
trouble
can
come
of
it
but
they
are
men
who
will
make
a
clean
job
when
they
are
about
it
and
time
too
cried
ted
baldwin
folk
are
gettin
out
of
hand
in
these
parts
it
was
only
last
week
that
three
of
our
men
were
turned
off
by
foreman
blaker
it
s
been
owing
him
a
long
time
and
he
ll
get
it
full
and
proper
get
what
mcmurdo
whispered
to
his
neighbour
the
business
end
of
a
buckshot
cartridge
cried
the
man
with
a
loud
laugh
what
think
you
of
our
ways
brother
mcmurdo
s
criminal
soul
seemed
to
have
already
absorbed
the
spirit
of
the
vile
association
of
which
he
was
now
a
member
i
like
it
well
said
he
tis
a
proper
place
for
a
lad
of
mettle
several
of
those
who
sat
around
heard
his
words
and
applauded
them
what
s
that
cried
the
black
maned
bodymaster
from
the
end
of
the
table
tis
our
new
brother
sir
who
finds
our
ways
to
his
taste
mcmurdo
rose
to
his
feet
for
an
instant
i
would
say
eminent
bodymaster
that
if
a
man
should
be
wanted
i
should
take
it
as
an
honour
to
be
chosen
to
help
the
lodge
there
was
great
applause
at
this
it
was
felt
that
a
new
sun
was
pushing
its
rim
above
the
horizon
to
some
of
the
elders
it
seemed
that
the
progress
was
a
little
too
rapid
i
would
move
said
the
secretary
harraway
a
vulture
faced
old
graybeard
who
sat
near
the
chairman
that
brother
mcmurdo
should
wait
until
it
is
the
good
pleasure
of
the
lodge
to
employ
him
sure
that
was
what
i
meant
i
m
in
your
hands
said
mcmurdo
your
time
will
come
brother
said
the
chairman
we
have
marked
you
down
as
a
willing
man
and
we
believe
that
you
will
do
good
work
in
these
parts
there
is
a
small
matter
to
night
in
which
you
may
take
a
hand
if
it
so
please
you
i
will
wait
for
something
that
is
worth
while
you
can
come
to
night
anyhow
and
it
will
help
you
to
know
what
we
stand
for
in
this
community
i
will
make
the
announcement
later
meanwhile
he
glanced
at
his
agenda
paper
i
have
one
or
two
more
points
to
bring
before
the
meeting
first
of
all
i
will
ask
the
treasurer
as
to
our
bank
balance
there
is
the
pension
to
jim
carnaway
s
widow
he
was
struck
down
doing
the
work
of
the
lodge
and
it
is
for
us
to
see
that
she
is
not
the
loser
jim
was
shot
last
month
when
they
tried
to
kill
chester
wilcox
of
marley
creek
mcmurdo
s
neighbour
informed
him
the
funds
are
good
at
the
moment
said
the
treasurer
with
the
bankbook
in
front
of
him
the
firms
have
been
generous
of
late
max
linder
co
paid
five
hundred
to
be
left
alone
walker
brothers
sent
in
a
hundred
but
i
took
it
on
myself
to
return
it
and
ask
for
five
if
i
do
not
hear
by
wednesday
their
winding
gear
may
get
out
of
order
we
had
to
burn
their
breaker
last
year
before
they
became
reasonable
then
the
west
section
coaling
company
has
paid
its
annual
contribution
we
have
enough
on
hand
to
meet
any
obligations
what
about
archie
swindon
asked
a
brother
he
has
sold
out
and
left
the
district
the
old
devil
left
a
note
for
us
to
say
that
he
had
rather
be
a
free
crossing
sweeper
in
new
york
than
a
large
mine
owner
under
the
power
of
a
ring
of
blackmailers
by
gar
it
was
as
well
that
he
made
a
break
for
it
before
the
note
reached
us
i
guess
he
won
t
show
his
face
in
this
valley
again
an
elderly
clean
shaved
man
with
a
kindly
face
and
a
good
brow
rose
from
the
end
of
the
table
which
faced
the
chairman
mr
treasurer
he
asked
may
i
ask
who
has
bought
the
property
of
this
man
that
we
have
driven
out
of
the
district
yes
brother
morris
it
has
been
bought
by
the
state
merton
county
railroad
company
and
who
bought
the
mines
of
todman
and
of
lee
that
came
into
the
market
in
the
same
way
last
year
the
same
company
brother
morris
and
who
bought
the
ironworks
of
manson
and
of
shuman
and
of
van
deher
and
of
atwood
which
have
all
been
given
up
of
late
they
were
all
bought
by
the
west
gilmerton
general
mining
company
i
don
t
see
brother
morris
said
the
chairman
that
it
matters
to
us
who
buys
them
since
they
can
t
carry
them
out
of
the
district
with
all
respect
to
you
eminent
bodymaster
i
think
it
may
matter
very
much
to
us
this
process
has
been
going
on
now
for
ten
long
years
we
are
gradually
driving
all
the
small
men
out
of
trade
what
is
the
result
we
find
in
their
places
great
companies
like
the
railroad
or
the
general
iron
who
have
their
directors
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
and
care
nothing
for
our
threats
we
can
take
it
out
of
their
local
bosses
but
it
only
means
that
others
will
be
sent
in
their
stead
and
we
are
making
it
dangerous
for
ourselves
the
small
men
could
not
harm
us
they
had
not
the
money
nor
the
power
so
long
as
we
did
not
squeeze
them
too
dry
they
would
stay
on
under
our
power
but
if
these
big
companies
find
that
we
stand
between
them
and
their
profits
they
will
spare
no
pains
and
no
expense
to
hunt
us
down
and
bring
us
to
court
there
was
a
hush
at
these
ominous
words
and
every
face
darkened
as
gloomy
looks
were
exchanged
so
omnipotent
and
unchallenged
had
they
been
that
the
very
thought
that
there
was
possible
retribution
in
the
background
had
been
banished
from
their
minds
and
yet
the
idea
struck
a
chill
to
the
most
reckless
of
them
it
is
my
advice
the
speaker
continued
that
we
go
easier
upon
the
small
men
on
the
day
that
they
have
all
been
driven
out
the
power
of
this
society
will
have
been
broken
unwelcome
truths
are
not
popular
there
were
angry
cries
as
the
speaker
resumed
his
seat
mcginty
rose
with
gloom
upon
his
brow
brother
morris
said
he
you
were
always
a
croaker
so
long
as
the
members
of
this
lodge
stand
together
there
is
no
power
in
the
united
states
that
can
touch
them
sure
have
we
not
tried
it
often
enough
in
the
lawcourts
i
expect
the
big
companies
will
find
it
easier
to
pay
than
to
fight
same
as
the
little
companies
do
and
now
brethren
mcginty
took
off
his
black
velvet
cap
and
his
stole
as
he
spoke
this
lodge
has
finished
its
business
for
the
evening
save
for
one
small
matter
which
may
be
mentioned
when
we
are
parting
the
time
has
now
come
for
fraternal
refreshment
and
for
harmony
strange
indeed
is
human
nature
here
were
these
men
to
whom
murder
was
familiar
who
again
and
again
had
struck
down
the
father
of
the
family
some
man
against
whom
they
had
no
personal
feeling
without
one
thought
of
compunction
or
of
compassion
for
his
weeping
wife
or
helpless
children
and
yet
the
tender
or
pathetic
in
music
could
move
them
to
tears
mcmurdo
had
a
fine
tenor
voice
and
if
he
had
failed
to
gain
the
good
will
of
the
lodge
before
it
could
no
longer
have
been
withheld
after
he
had
thrilled
them
with
i
m
sitting
on
the
stile
mary
and
on
the
banks
of
allan
water
in
his
very
first
night
the
new
recruit
had
made
himself
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
brethren
marked
already
for
advancement
and
high
office
there
were
other
qualities
needed
however
besides
those
of
good
fellowship
to
make
a
worthy
freeman
and
of
these
he
was
given
an
example
before
the
evening
was
over
the
whisky
bottle
had
passed
round
many
times
and
the
men
were
flushed
and
ripe
for
mischief
when
their
bodymaster
rose
once
more
to
address
them
boys
said
he
there
s
one
man
in
this
town
that
wants
trimming
up
and
it
s
for
you
to
see
that
he
gets
it
i
m
speaking
of
james
stanger
of
the
herald
you
ve
seen
how
he
s
been
opening
his
mouth
against
us
again
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
with
many
a
muttered
oath
mcginty
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
law
and
order
that
s
how
he
heads
it
reign
of
terror
in
the
coal
and
iron
district
twelve
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
first
assassinations
which
proved
the
existence
of
a
criminal
organization
in
our
midst
from
that
day
these
outrages
have
never
ceased
until
now
they
have
reached
a
pitch
which
makes
us
the
opprobrium
of
the
civilized
world
is
it
for
such
results
as
this
that
our
great
country
welcomes
to
its
bosom
the
alien
who
flies
from
the
despotisms
of
europe
is
it
that
they
shall
themselves
become
tyrants
over
the
very
men
who
have
given
them
shelter
and
that
a
state
of
terrorism
and
lawlessness
should
be
established
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
sacred
folds
of
the
starry
flag
of
freedom
which
would
raise
horror
in
our
minds
if
we
read
of
it
as
existing
under
the
most
effete
monarchy
of
the
east
the
men
are
known
the
organization
is
patent
and
public
how
long
are
we
to
endure
it
can
we
forever
live
sure
i
ve
read
enough
of
the
slush
cried
the
chairman
tossing
the
paper
down
upon
the
table
that
s
what
he
says
of
us
the
question
i
m
asking
you
is
what
shall
we
say
to
him
kill
him
cried
a
dozen
fierce
voices
i
protest
against
that
said
brother
morris
the
man
of
the
good
brow
and
shaved
face
i
tell
you
brethren
that
our
hand
is
too
heavy
in
this
valley
and
that
there
will
come
a
point
where
in
self
defense
every
man
will
unite
to
crush
us
out
james
stanger
is
an
old
man
he
is
respected
in
the
township
and
the
district
his
paper
stands
for
all
that
is
solid
in
the
valley
if
that
man
is
struck
down
there
will
be
a
stir
through
this
state
that
will
only
end
with
our
destruction
and
how
would
they
bring
about
our
destruction
mr
standback
cried
mcginty
is
it
by
the
police
sure
half
of
them
are
in
our
pay
and
half
of
them
afraid
of
us
or
is
it
by
the
law
courts
and
the
judge
haven
t
we
tried
that
before
now
and
what
ever
came
of
it
there
is
a
judge
lynch
that
might
try
the
case
said
brother
morris
a
general
shout
of
anger
greeted
the
suggestion
i
have
but
to
raise
my
finger
cried
mcginty
and
i
could
put
two
hundred
men
into
this
town
that
would
clear
it
out
from
end
to
end
then
suddenly
raising
his
voice
and
bending
his
huge
black
brows
into
a
terrible
frown
see
here
brother
morris
i
have
my
eye
on
you
and
have
had
for
some
time
you
ve
no
heart
yourself
and
you
try
to
take
the
heart
out
of
others
it
will
be
an
ill
day
for
you
brother
morris
when
your
own
name
comes
on
our
agenda
paper
and
i
m
thinking
that
it
s
just
there
that
i
ought
to
place
it
morris
had
turned
deadly
pale
and
his
knees
seemed
to
give
way
under
him
as
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
he
raised
his
glass
in
his
trembling
hand
and
drank
before
he
could
answer
i
apologize
eminent
bodymaster
to
you
and
to
every
brother
in
this
lodge
if
i
have
said
more
than
i
should
i
am
a
faithful
member
you
all
know
that
and
it
is
my
fear
lest
evil
come
to
the
lodge
which
makes
me
speak
in
anxious
words
but
i
have
greater
trust
in
your
judgment
than
in
my
own
eminent
bodymaster
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
not
offend
again
the
bodymaster
s
scowl
relaxed
as
he
listened
to
the
humble
words
very
good
brother
morris
it
s
myself
that
would
be
sorry
if
it
were
needful
to
give
you
a
lesson
but
so
long
as
i
am
in
this
chair
we
shall
be
a
united
lodge
in
word
and
in
deed
and
now
boys
he
continued
looking
round
at
the
company
i
ll
say
this
much
that
if
stanger
got
his
full
deserts
there
would
be
more
trouble
than
we
need
ask
for
these
editors
hang
together
and
every
journal
in
the
state
would
be
crying
out
for
police
and
troops
but
i
guess
you
can
give
him
a
pretty
severe
warning
will
you
fix
it
brother
baldwin
sure
said
the
young
man
eagerly
how
many
will
you
take
half
a
dozen
and
two
to
guard
the
door
you
ll
come
gower
and
you
mansel
and
you
scanlan
and
the
two
willabys
i
promised
the
new
brother
he
should
go
said
the
chairman
ted
baldwin
looked
at
mcmurdo
with
eyes
which
showed
that
he
had
not
forgotten
nor
forgiven
well
he
can
come
if
he
wants
he
said
in
a
surly
voice
that
s
enough
the
sooner
we
get
to
work
the
better
the
company
broke
up
with
shouts
and
yells
and
snatches
of
drunken
song
the
bar
was
still
crowded
with
revellers
and
many
of
the
brethren
remained
there
the
little
band
who
had
been
told
off
for
duty
passed
out
into
the
street
proceeding
in
twos
and
threes
along
the
sidewalk
so
as
not
to
provoke
attention
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
night
with
a
half
moon
shining
brilliantly
in
a
frosty
star
spangled
sky
the
men
stopped
and
gathered
in
a
yard
which
faced
a
high
building
the
words
vermissa
herald
were
printed
in
gold
lettering
between
the
brightly
lit
windows
from
within
came
the
clanking
of
the
printing
press
here
you
said
baldwin
to
mcmurdo
you
can
stand
below
at
the
door
and
see
that
the
road
is
kept
open
for
us
arthur
willaby
can
stay
with
you
you
others
come
with
me
have
no
fears
boys
for
we
have
a
dozen
witnesses
that
we
are
in
the
union
bar
at
this
very
moment
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
the
street
was
deserted
save
for
one
or
two
revellers
upon
their
way
home
the
party
crossed
the
road
and
pushing
open
the
door
of
the
newspaper
office
baldwin
and
his
men
rushed
in
and
up
the
stair
which
faced
them
mcmurdo
and
another
remained
below
from
the
room
above
came
a
shout
a
cry
for
help
and
then
the
sound
of
trampling
feet
and
of
falling
chairs
an
instant
later
a
gray
haired
man
rushed
out
on
the
landing
he
was
seized
before
he
could
get
farther
and
his
spectacles
came
tinkling
down
to
mcmurdo
s
feet
there
was
a
thud
and
a
groan
he
was
on
his
face
and
half
a
dozen
sticks
were
clattering
together
as
they
fell
upon
him
he
writhed
and
his
long
thin
limbs
quivered
under
the
blows
the
others
ceased
at
last
but
baldwin
his
cruel
face
set
in
an
infernal
smile
was
hacking
at
the
man
s
head
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
defend
with
his
arms
his
white
hair
was
dabbled
with
patches
of
blood
baldwin
was
still
stooping
over
his
victim
putting
in
a
short
vicious
blow
whenever
he
could
see
a
part
exposed
when
mcmurdo
dashed
up
the
stair
and
pushed
him
back
you
ll
kill
the
man
said
he
drop
it
baldwin
looked
at
him
in
amazement
curse
you
he
cried
who
are
you
to
interfere
you
that
are
new
to
the
lodge
stand
back
he
raised
his
stick
but
mcmurdo
had
whipped
his
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
stand
back
yourself
he
cried
i
ll
blow
your
face
in
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
as
to
the
lodge
wasn
t
it
the
order
of
the
bodymaster
that
the
man
was
not
to
be
killed
and
what
are
you
doing
but
killing
him
it
s
truth
he
says
remarked
one
of
the
men
by
gar
you
d
best
hurry
yourselves
cried
the
man
below
the
windows
are
all
lighting
up
and
you
ll
have
the
whole
town
here
inside
of
five
minutes
there
was
indeed
the
sound
of
shouting
in
the
street
and
a
little
group
of
compositors
and
pressmen
was
forming
in
the
hall
below
and
nerving
itself
to
action
leaving
the
limp
and
motionless
body
of
the
editor
at
the
head
of
the
stair
the
criminals
rushed
down
and
made
their
way
swiftly
along
the
street
having
reached
the
union
house
some
of
them
mixed
with
the
crowd
in
mcginty
s
saloon
whispering
across
the
bar
to
the
boss
that
the
job
had
been
well
carried
through
others
and
among
them
mcmurdo
broke
away
into
side
streets
and
so
by
devious
paths
to
their
own
homes
chapter
the
valley
of
fear
when
mcmurdo
awoke
next
morning
he
had
good
reason
to
remember
his
initiation
into
the
lodge
his
head
ached
with
the
effect
of
the
drink
and
his
arm
where
he
had
been
branded
was
hot
and
swollen
having
his
own
peculiar
source
of
income
he
was
irregular
in
his
attendance
at
his
work
so
he
had
a
late
breakfast
and
remained
at
home
for
the
morning
writing
a
long
letter
to
a
friend
afterwards
he
read
the
daily
herald
in
a
special
column
put
in
at
the
last
moment
he
read
outrage
at
the
herald
office
editor
seriously
injured
it
was
a
short
account
of
the
facts
with
which
he
was
himself
more
familiar
than
the
writer
could
have
been
it
ended
with
the
statement
the
matter
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
police
but
it
can
hardly
be
hoped
that
their
exertions
will
be
attended
by
any
better
results
than
in
the
past
some
of
the
men
were
recognized
and
there
is
hope
that
a
conviction
may
be
obtained
the
source
of
the
outrage
was
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
infamous
society
which
has
held
this
community
in
bondage
for
so
long
a
period
and
against
which
the
herald
has
taken
so
uncompromising
a
stand
mr
stanger
s
many
friends
will
rejoice
to
hear
that
though
he
has
been
cruelly
and
brutally
beaten
and
though
he
has
sustained
severe
injuries
about
the
head
there
is
no
immediate
danger
to
his
life
below
it
stated
that
a
guard
of
police
armed
with
winchester
rifles
had
been
requisitioned
for
the
defense
of
the
office
mcmurdo
had
laid
down
the
paper
and
was
lighting
his
pipe
with
a
hand
which
was
shaky
from
the
excesses
of
the
previous
evening
when
there
was
a
knock
outside
and
his
landlady
brought
to
him
a
note
which
had
just
been
handed
in
by
a
lad
it
was
unsigned
and
ran
thus
i
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
but
would
rather
not
do
so
in
your
house
you
will
find
me
beside
the
flagstaff
upon
miller
hill
if
you
will
come
there
now
i
have
something
which
it
is
important
for
you
to
hear
and
for
me
to
say
mcmurdo
read
the
note
twice
with
the
utmost
surprise
for
he
could
not
imagine
what
it
meant
or
who
was
the
author
of
it
had
it
been
in
a
feminine
hand
he
might
have
imagined
that
it
was
the
beginning
of
one
of
those
adventures
which
had
been
familiar
enough
in
his
past
life
but
it
was
the
writing
of
a
man
and
of
a
well
educated
one
too
finally
after
some
hesitation
he
determined
to
see
the
matter
through
miller
hill
is
an
ill
kept
public
park
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
in
summer
it
is
a
favourite
resort
of
the
people
but
in
winter
it
is
desolate
enough
from
the
top
of
it
one
has
a
view
not
only
of
the
whole
straggling
grimy
town
but
of
the
winding
valley
beneath
with
its
scattered
mines
and
factories
blackening
the
snow
on
each
side
of
it
and
of
the
wooded
and
white
capped
ranges
flanking
it
mcmurdo
strolled
up
the
winding
path
hedged
in
with
evergreens
until
he
reached
the
deserted
restaurant
which
forms
the
centre
of
summer
gaiety
beside
it
was
a
bare
flagstaff
and
underneath
it
a
man
his
hat
drawn
down
and
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
turned
up
when
he
turned
his
face
mcmurdo
saw
that
it
was
brother
morris
he
who
had
incurred
the
anger
of
the
bodymaster
the
night
before
the
lodge
sign
was
given
and
exchanged
as
they
met
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
mr
mcmurdo
said
the
older
man
speaking
with
a
hesitation
which
showed
that
he
was
on
delicate
ground
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
why
did
you
not
put
your
name
to
the
note
one
has
to
be
cautious
mister
one
never
knows
in
times
like
these
how
a
thing
may
come
back
to
one
one
never
knows
either
who
to
trust
or
who
not
to
trust
surely
one
may
trust
brothers
of
the
lodge
no
no
not
always
cried
morris
with
vehemence
whatever
we
say
even
what
we
think
seems
to
go
back
to
that
man
mcginty
look
here
said
mcmurdo
sternly
it
was
only
last
night
as
you
know
well
that
i
swore
good
faith
to
our
bodymaster
would
you
be
asking
me
to
break
my
oath
if
that
is
the
view
you
take
said
morris
sadly
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
sorry
i
gave
you
the
trouble
to
come
and
meet
me
things
have
come
to
a
bad
pass
when
two
free
citizens
cannot
speak
their
thoughts
to
each
other
mcmurdo
who
had
been
watching
his
companion
very
narrowly
relaxed
somewhat
in
his
bearing
sure
i
spoke
for
myself
only
said
he
i
am
a
newcomer
as
you
know
and
i
am
strange
to
it
all
it
is
not
for
me
to
open
my
mouth
mr
morris
and
if
you
think
well
to
say
anything
to
me
i
am
here
to
hear
it
and
to
take
it
back
to
boss
mcginty
said
morris
bitterly
indeed
then
you
do
me
injustice
there
cried
mcmurdo
for
myself
i
am
loyal
to
the
lodge
and
so
i
tell
you
straight
but
i
would
be
a
poor
creature
if
i
were
to
repeat
to
any
other
what
you
might
say
to
me
in
confidence
it
will
go
no
further
than
me
though
i
warn
you
that
you
may
get
neither
help
nor
sympathy
i
have
given
up
looking
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
said
morris
i
may
be
putting
my
very
life
in
your
hands
by
what
i
say
but
bad
as
you
are
and
it
seemed
to
me
last
night
that
you
were
shaping
to
be
as
bad
as
the
worst
still
you
are
new
to
it
and
your
conscience
cannot
yet
be
as
hardened
as
theirs
that
was
why
i
thought
to
speak
with
you
well
what
have
you
to
say
if
you
give
me
away
may
a
curse
be
on
you
sure
i
said
i
would
not
i
would
ask
you
then
when
you
joined
the
freeman
s
society
in
chicago
and
swore
vows
of
charity
and
fidelity
did
ever
it
cross
your
mind
that
you
might
find
it
would
lead
you
to
crime
if
you
call
it
crime
mcmurdo
answered
call
it
crime
cried
morris
his
voice
vibrating
with
passion
you
have
seen
little
of
it
if
you
can
call
it
anything
else
was
it
crime
last
night
when
a
man
old
enough
to
be
your
father
was
beaten
till
the
blood
dripped
from
his
white
hairs
was
that
crime
or
what
else
would
you
call
it
there
are
some
would
say
it
was
war
said
mcmurdo
a
war
of
two
classes
with
all
in
so
that
each
struck
as
best
it
could
well
did
you
think
of
such
a
thing
when
you
joined
the
freeman
s
society
at
chicago
no
i
m
bound
to
say
i
did
not
nor
did
i
when
i
joined
it
at
philadelphia
it
was
just
a
benefit
club
and
a
meeting
place
for
one
s
fellows
then
i
heard
of
this
place
curse
the
hour
that
the
name
first
fell
upon
my
ears
and
i
came
to
better
myself
my
god
to
better
myself
my
wife
and
three
children
came
with
me
i
started
a
drygoods
store
on
market
square
and
i
prospered
well
the
word
had
gone
round
that
i
was
a
freeman
and
i
was
forced
to
join
the
local
lodge
same
as
you
did
last
night
i
ve
the
badge
of
shame
on
my
forearm
and
something
worse
branded
on
my
heart
i
found
that
i
was
under
the
orders
of
a
black
villain
and
caught
in
a
meshwork
of
crime
what
could
i
do
every
word
i
said
to
make
things
better
was
taken
as
treason
same
as
it
was
last
night
i
can
t
get
away
for
all
i
have
in
the
world
is
in
my
store
if
i
leave
the
society
i
know
well
that
it
means
murder
to
me
and
god
knows
what
to
my
wife
and
children
oh
man
it
is
awful
awful
he
put
his
hands
to
his
face
and
his
body
shook
with
convulsive
sobs
mcmurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
were
too
soft
for
the
job
said
he
you
are
the
wrong
sort
for
such
work
i
had
a
conscience
and
a
religion
but
they
made
me
a
criminal
among
them
i
was
chosen
for
a
job
if
i
backed
down
i
knew
well
what
would
come
to
me
maybe
i
m
a
coward
maybe
it
s
the
thought
of
my
poor
little
woman
and
the
children
that
makes
me
one
anyhow
i
went
i
guess
it
will
haunt
me
forever
it
was
a
lonely
house
twenty
miles
from
here
over
the
range
yonder
i
was
told
off
for
the
door
same
as
you
were
last
night
they
could
not
trust
me
with
the
job
the
others
went
in
when
they
came
out
their
hands
were
crimson
to
the
wrists
as
we
turned
away
a
child
was
screaming
out
of
the
house
behind
us
it
was
a
boy
of
five
who
had
seen
his
father
murdered
i
nearly
fainted
with
the
horror
of
it
and
yet
i
had
to
keep
a
bold
and
smiling
face
for
well
i
knew
that
if
i
did
not
it
would
be
out
of
my
house
that
they
would
come
next
with
their
bloody
hands
and
it
would
be
my
little
fred
that
would
be
screaming
for
his
father
but
i
was
a
criminal
then
part
sharer
in
a
murder
lost
forever
in
this
world
and
lost
also
in
the
next
i
am
a
good
catholic
but
the
priest
would
have
no
word
with
me
when
he
heard
i
was
a
scowrer
and
i
am
excommunicated
from
my
faith
that
s
how
it
stands
with
me
and
i
see
you
going
down
the
same
road
and
i
ask
you
what
the
end
is
to
be
are
you
ready
to
be
a
cold
blooded
murderer
also
or
can
we
do
anything
to
stop
it
what
would
you
do
asked
mcmurdo
abruptly
you
would
not
inform
god
forbid
cried
morris
sure
the
very
thought
would
cost
me
my
life
that
s
well
said
mcmurdo
i
m
thinking
that
you
are
a
weak
man
and
that
you
make
too
much
of
the
matter
too
much
wait
till
you
have
lived
here
longer
look
down
the
valley
see
the
cloud
of
a
hundred
chimneys
that
overshadows
it
i
tell
you
that
the
cloud
of
murder
hangs
thicker
and
lower
than
that
over
the
heads
of
the
people
it
is
the
valley
of
fear
the
valley
of
death
the
terror
is
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
from
the
dusk
to
the
dawn
wait
young
man
and
you
will
learn
for
yourself
well
i
ll
let
you
know
what
i
think
when
i
have
seen
more
said
mcmurdo
carelessly
what
is
very
clear
is
that
you
are
not
the
man
for
the
place
and
that
the
sooner
you
sell
out
if
you
only
get
a
dime
a
dollar
for
what
the
business
is
worth
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
what
you
have
said
is
safe
with
me
but
by
gar
if
i
thought
you
were
an
informer
no
no
cried
morris
piteously
well
let
it
rest
at
that
i
ll
bear
what
you
have
said
in
mind
and
maybe
some
day
i
ll
come
back
to
it
i
expect
you
meant
kindly
by
speaking
to
me
like
this
now
i
ll
be
getting
home
one
word
before
you
go
said
morris
we
may
have
been
seen
together
they
may
want
to
know
what
we
have
spoken
about
ah
that
s
well
thought
of
i
offer
you
a
clerkship
in
my
store
and
i
refuse
it
that
s
our
business
well
so
long
brother
morris
and
may
you
find
things
go
better
with
you
in
the
future
that
same
afternoon
as
mcmurdo
sat
smoking
lost
in
thought
beside
the
stove
of
his
sitting
room
the
door
swung
open
and
its
framework
was
filled
with
the
huge
figure
of
boss
mcginty
he
passed
the
sign
and
then
seating
himself
opposite
to
the
young
man
he
looked
at
him
steadily
for
some
time
a
look
which
was
as
steadily
returned
i
m
not
much
of
a
visitor
brother
mcmurdo
he
said
at
last
i
guess
i
am
too
busy
over
the
folk
that
visit
me
but
i
thought
i
d
stretch
a
point
and
drop
down
to
see
you
in
your
own
house
i
m
proud
to
see
you
here
councillor
mcmurdo
answered
heartily
bringing
his
whisky
bottle
out
of
the
cupboard
it
s
an
honour
that
i
had
not
expected
how
s
the
arm
asked
the
boss
mcmurdo
made
a
wry
face
well
i
m
not
forgetting
it
he
said
but
it
s
worth
it
yes
it
s
worth
it
the
other
answered
to
those
that
are
loyal
and
go
through
with
it
and
are
a
help
to
the
lodge
what
were
you
speaking
to
brother
morris
about
on
miller
hill
this
morning
the
question
came
so
suddenly
that
it
was
well
that
he
had
his
answer
prepared
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
morris
didn
t
know
i
could
earn
a
living
here
at
home
he
shan
t
know
either
for
he
has
got
too
much
conscience
for
the
likes
of
me
but
he
s
a
good
hearted
old
chap
it
was
his
idea
that
i
was
at
a
loose
end
and
that
he
would
do
me
a
good
turn
by
offering
me
a
clerkship
in
a
drygoods
store
oh
that
was
it
yes
that
was
it
and
you
refused
it
sure
couldn
t
i
earn
ten
times
as
much
in
my
own
bedroom
with
four
hours
work
that
s
so
but
i
wouldn
t
get
about
too
much
with
morris
why
not
well
i
guess
because
i
tell
you
not
that
s
enough
for
most
folk
in
these
parts
it
may
be
enough
for
most
folk
but
it
ain
t
enough
for
me
councillor
said
mcmurdo
boldly
if
you
are
a
judge
of
men
you
ll
know
that
the
swarthy
giant
glared
at
him
and
his
hairy
paw
closed
for
an
instant
round
the
glass
as
though
he
would
hurl
it
at
the
head
of
his
companion
then
he
laughed
in
his
loud
boisterous
insincere
fashion
you
re
a
queer
card
for
sure
said
he
well
if
you
want
reasons
i
ll
give
them
did
morris
say
nothing
to
you
against
the
lodge
no
nor
against
me
no
well
that
s
because
he
daren
t
trust
you
but
in
his
heart
he
is
not
a
loyal
brother
we
know
that
well
so
we
watch
him
and
we
wait
for
the
time
to
admonish
him
i
m
thinking
that
the
time
is
drawing
near
there
s
no
room
for
scabby
sheep
in
our
pen
but
if
you
keep
company
with
a
disloyal
man
we
might
think
that
you
were
disloyal
too
see
there
s
no
chance
of
my
keeping
company
with
him
for
i
dislike
the
man
mcmurdo
answered
as
to
being
disloyal
if
it
was
any
man
but
you
he
would
not
use
the
word
to
me
twice
well
that
s
enough
said
mcginty
draining
off
his
glass
i
came
down
to
give
you
a
word
in
season
and
you
ve
had
it
i
d
like
to
know
said
mcmurdo
how
you
ever
came
to
learn
that
i
had
spoken
with
morris
at
all
mcginty
laughed
it
s
my
business
to
know
what
goes
on
in
this
township
said
he
i
guess
you
d
best
reckon
on
my
hearing
all
that
passes
well
time
s
up
and
i
ll
just
say
but
his
leavetaking
was
cut
short
in
a
very
unexpected
fashion
with
a
sudden
crash
the
door
flew
open
and
three
frowning
intent
faces
glared
in
at
them
from
under
the
peaks
of
police
caps
mcmurdo
sprang
to
his
feet
and
half
drew
his
revolver
but
his
arm
stopped
midway
as
he
became
conscious
that
two
winchester
rifles
were
levelled
at
his
head
a
man
in
uniform
advanced
into
the
room
a
six
shooter
in
his
hand
it
was
captain
marvin
once
of
chicago
and
now
of
the
mine
constabulary
he
shook
his
head
with
a
half
smile
at
mcmurdo
i
thought
you
d
be
getting
into
trouble
mr
crooked
mcmurdo
of
chicago
said
he
can
t
keep
out
of
it
can
you
take
your
hat
and
come
along
with
us
i
guess
you
ll
pay
for
this
captain
marvin
said
mcginty
who
are
you
i
d
like
to
know
to
break
into
a
house
in
this
fashion
and
molest
honest
law
abiding
men
you
re
standing
out
in
this
deal
councillor
mcginty
said
the
police
captain
we
are
not
out
after
you
but
after
this
man
mcmurdo
it
is
for
you
to
help
not
to
hinder
us
in
our
duty
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
ll
answer
for
his
conduct
said
the
boss
by
all
accounts
mr
mcginty
you
may
have
to
answer
for
your
own
conduct
some
of
these
days
the
captain
answered
this
man
mcmurdo
was
a
crook
before
ever
he
came
here
and
he
s
a
crook
still
cover
him
patrolman
while
i
disarm
him
there
s
my
pistol
said
mcmurdo
coolly
maybe
captain
marvin
if
you
and
i
were
alone
and
face
to
face
you
would
not
take
me
so
easily
where
s
your
warrant
asked
mcginty
by
gar
a
man
might
as
well
live
in
russia
as
in
vermissa
while
folk
like
you
are
running
the
police
it
s
a
capitalist
outrage
and
you
ll
hear
more
of
it
i
reckon
you
do
what
you
think
is
your
duty
the
best
way
you
can
councillor
we
ll
look
after
ours
what
am
i
accused
of
asked
mcmurdo
of
being
concerned
in
the
beating
of
old
editor
stanger
at
the
herald
office
it
wasn
t
your
fault
that
it
isn
t
a
murder
charge
well
if
that
s
all
you
have
against
him
cried
mcginty
with
a
laugh
you
can
save
yourself
a
deal
of
trouble
by
dropping
it
right
now
this
man
was
with
me
in
my
saloon
playing
poker
up
to
midnight
and
i
can
bring
a
dozen
to
prove
it
that
s
your
affair
and
i
guess
you
can
settle
it
in
court
to
morrow
meanwhile
come
on
mcmurdo
and
come
quietly
if
you
don
t
want
a
gun
across
your
head
you
stand
wide
mr
mcginty
for
i
warn
you
i
will
stand
no
resistance
when
i
am
on
duty
so
determined
was
the
appearance
of
the
captain
that
both
mcmurdo
and
his
boss
were
forced
to
accept
the
situation
the
latter
managed
to
have
a
few
whispered
words
with
the
prisoner
before
they
parted
what
about
he
jerked
his
thumb
upward
to
signify
the
coining
plant
all
right
whispered
mcmurdo
who
had
devised
a
safe
hiding
place
under
the
floor
i
ll
bid
you
good
bye
said
the
boss
shaking
hands
i
ll
see
reilly
the
lawyer
and
take
the
defense
upon
myself
take
my
word
for
it
that
they
won
t
be
able
to
hold
you
i
wouldn
t
bet
on
that
guard
the
prisoner
you
two
and
shoot
him
if
he
tries
any
games
i
ll
search
the
house
before
i
leave
he
did
so
but
apparently
found
no
trace
of
the
concealed
plant
when
he
had
descended
he
and
his
men
escorted
mcmurdo
to
headquarters
darkness
had
fallen
and
a
keen
blizzard
was
blowing
so
that
the
streets
were
nearly
deserted
but
a
few
loiterers
followed
the
group
and
emboldened
by
invisibility
shouted
imprecations
at
the
prisoner
lynch
the
cursed
scowrer
they
cried
lynch
him
they
laughed
and
jeered
as
he
was
pushed
into
the
police
station
after
a
short
formal
examination
from
the
inspector
in
charge
he
was
put
into
the
common
cell
here
he
found
baldwin
and
three
other
criminals
of
the
night
before
all
arrested
that
afternoon
and
waiting
their
trial
next
morning
but
even
within
this
inner
fortress
of
the
law
the
long
arm
of
the
freemen
was
able
to
extend
late
at
night
there
came
a
jailer
with
a
straw
bundle
for
their
bedding
out
of
which
he
extracted
two
bottles
of
whisky
some
glasses
and
a
pack
of
cards
they
spent
a
hilarious
night
without
an
anxious
thought
as
to
the
ordeal
of
the
morning
nor
had
they
cause
as
the
result
was
to
show
the
magistrate
could
not
possibly
on
the
evidence
have
held
them
for
a
higher
court
on
the
one
hand
the
compositors
and
pressmen
were
forced
to
admit
that
the
light
was
uncertain
that
they
were
themselves
much
perturbed
and
that
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
the
assailants
although
they
believed
that
the
accused
were
among
them
cross
examined
by
the
clever
attorney
who
had
been
engaged
by
mcginty
they
were
even
more
nebulous
in
their
evidence
the
injured
man
had
already
deposed
that
he
was
so
taken
by
surprise
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
that
he
could
state
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
first
man
who
struck
him
wore
a
moustache
he
added
that
he
knew
them
to
be
scowrers
since
no
one
else
in
the
community
could
possibly
have
any
enmity
to
him
and
he
had
long
been
threatened
on
account
of
his
outspoken
editorials
on
the
other
hand
it
was
clearly
shown
by
the
united
and
unfaltering
evidence
of
six
citizens
including
that
high
municipal
official
councillor
mcginty
that
the
men
had
been
at
a
card
party
at
the
union
house
until
an
hour
very
much
later
than
the
commission
of
the
outrage
needless
to
say
that
they
were
discharged
with
something
very
near
to
an
apology
from
the
bench
for
the
inconvenience
to
which
they
had
been
put
together
with
an
implied
censure
of
captain
marvin
and
the
police
for
their
officious
zeal
the
verdict
was
greeted
with
loud
applause
by
a
court
in
which
mcmurdo
saw
many
familiar
faces
brothers
of
the
lodge
smiled
and
waved
but
there
were
others
who
sat
with
compressed
lips
and
brooding
eyes
as
the
men
filed
out
of
the
dock
one
of
them
a
little
dark
bearded
resolute
fellow
put
the
thoughts
of
himself
and
comrades
into
words
as
the
ex
prisoners
passed
him
you
damned
murderers
he
said
we
ll
fix
you
yet
chapter
the
darkest
hour
if
anything
had
been
needed
to
give
an
impetus
to
jack
mcmurdo
s
popularity
among
his
fellows
it
would
have
been
his
arrest
and
acquittal
that
a
man
on
the
very
night
of
joining
the
lodge
should
have
done
something
which
brought
him
before
the
magistrate
was
a
new
record
in
the
annals
of
the
society
already
he
had
earned
the
reputation
of
a
good
boon
companion
a
cheery
reveller
and
withal
a
man
of
high
temper
who
would
not
take
an
insult
even
from
the
all
powerful
boss
himself
but
in
addition
to
this
he
impressed
his
comrades
with
the
idea
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
whose
brain
was
so
ready
to
devise
a
bloodthirsty
scheme
or
whose
hand
would
be
more
capable
of
carrying
it
out
he
ll
be
the
boy
for
the
clean
job
said
the
oldsters
to
one
another
and
waited
their
time
until
they
could
set
him
to
his
work
mcginty
had
instruments
enough
already
but
he
recognized
that
this
was
a
supremely
able
one
he
felt
like
a
man
holding
a
fierce
bloodhound
in
leash
there
were
curs
to
do
the
smaller
work
but
some
day
he
would
slip
this
creature
upon
its
prey
a
few
members
of
the
lodge
ted
baldwin
among
them
resented
the
rapid
rise
of
the
stranger
and
hated
him
for
it
but
they
kept
clear
of
him
for
he
was
as
ready
to
fight
as
to
laugh
but
if
he
gained
favour
with
his
fellows
there
was
another
quarter
one
which
had
become
even
more
vital
to
him
in
which
he
lost
it
ettie
shafter
s
father
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
nor
would
he
allow
him
to
enter
the
house
ettie
herself
was
too
deeply
in
love
to
give
him
up
altogether
and
yet
her
own
good
sense
warned
her
of
what
would
come
from
a
marriage
with
a
man
who
was
regarded
as
a
criminal
one
morning
after
a
sleepless
night
she
determined
to
see
him
possibly
for
the
last
time
and
make
one
strong
endeavour
to
draw
him
from
those
evil
influences
which
were
sucking
him
down
she
went
to
his
house
as
he
had
often
begged
her
to
do
and
made
her
way
into
the
room
which
he
used
as
his
sitting
room
he
was
seated
at
a
table
with
his
back
turned
and
a
letter
in
front
of
him
a
sudden
spirit
of
girlish
mischief
came
over
her
she
was
still
only
nineteen
he
had
not
heard
her
when
she
pushed
open
the
door
now
she
tiptoed
forward
and
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
his
bended
shoulders
if
she
had
expected
to
startle
him
she
certainly
succeeded
but
only
in
turn
to
be
startled
herself
with
a
tiger
spring
he
turned
on
her
and
his
right
hand
was
feeling
for
her
throat
at
the
same
instant
with
the
other
hand
he
crumpled
up
the
paper
that
lay
before
him
for
an
instant
he
stood
glaring
then
astonishment
and
joy
took
the
place
of
the
ferocity
which
had
convulsed
his
features
a
ferocity
which
had
sent
her
shrinking
back
in
horror
as
from
something
which
had
never
before
intruded
into
her
gentle
life
it
s
you
said
he
mopping
his
brow
and
to
think
that
you
should
come
to
me
heart
of
my
heart
and
i
should
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
want
to
strangle
you
come
then
darling
and
he
held
out
his
arms
let
me
make
it
up
to
you
but
she
had
not
recovered
from
that
sudden
glimpse
of
guilty
fear
which
she
had
read
in
the
man
s
face
all
her
woman
s
instinct
told
her
that
it
was
not
the
mere
fright
of
a
man
who
is
startled
guilt
that
was
it
guilt
and
fear
what
s
come
over
you
jack
she
cried
why
were
you
so
scared
of
me
oh
jack
if
your
conscience
was
at
ease
you
would
not
have
looked
at
me
like
that
sure
i
was
thinking
of
other
things
and
when
you
came
tripping
so
lightly
on
those
fairy
feet
of
yours
no
no
it
was
more
than
that
jack
then
a
sudden
suspicion
seized
her
let
me
see
that
letter
you
were
writing
ah
ettie
i
couldn
t
do
that
her
suspicions
became
certainties
it
s
to
another
woman
she
cried
i
know
it
why
else
should
you
hold
it
from
me
was
it
to
your
wife
that
you
were
writing
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
are
not
a
married
man
you
a
stranger
that
nobody
knows
i
am
not
married
ettie
see
now
i
swear
it
you
re
the
only
one
woman
on
earth
to
me
by
the
cross
of
christ
i
swear
it
he
was
so
white
with
passionate
earnestness
that
she
could
not
but
believe
him
well
then
she
cried
why
will
you
not
show
me
the
letter
i
ll
tell
you
acushla
said
he
i
m
under
oath
not
to
show
it
and
just
as
i
wouldn
t
break
my
word
to
you
so
i
would
keep
it
to
those
who
hold
my
promise
it
s
the
business
of
the
lodge
and
even
to
you
it
s
secret
and
if
i
was
scared
when
a
hand
fell
on
me
can
t
you
understand
it
when
it
might
have
been
the
hand
of
a
detective
she
felt
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
he
gathered
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
away
her
fears
and
doubts
sit
here
by
me
then
it
s
a
queer
throne
for
such
a
queen
but
it
s
the
best
your
poor
lover
can
find
he
ll
do
better
for
you
some
of
these
days
i
m
thinking
now
your
mind
is
easy
once
again
is
it
not
how
can
it
ever
be
at
ease
jack
when
i
know
that
you
are
a
criminal
among
criminals
when
i
never
know
the
day
that
i
may
hear
you
are
in
court
for
murder
mcmurdo
the
scowrer
that
s
what
one
of
our
boarders
called
you
yesterday
it
went
through
my
heart
like
a
knife
sure
hard
words
break
no
bones
but
they
were
true
well
dear
it
s
not
so
bad
as
you
think
we
are
but
poor
men
that
are
trying
in
our
own
way
to
get
our
rights
ettie
threw
her
arms
round
her
lover
s
neck
give
it
up
jack
for
my
sake
for
god
s
sake
give
it
up
it
was
to
ask
you
that
i
came
here
to
day
oh
jack
see
i
beg
it
of
you
on
my
bended
knees
kneeling
here
before
you
i
implore
you
to
give
it
up
he
raised
her
and
soothed
her
with
her
head
against
his
breast
sure
my
darlin
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
you
are
asking
how
could
i
give
it
up
when
it
would
be
to
break
my
oath
and
to
desert
my
comrades
if
you
could
see
how
things
stand
with
me
you
could
never
ask
it
of
me
besides
if
i
wanted
to
how
could
i
do
it
you
don
t
suppose
that
the
lodge
would
let
a
man
go
free
with
all
its
secrets
i
ve
thought
of
that
jack
i
ve
planned
it
all
father
has
saved
some
money
he
is
weary
of
this
place
where
the
fear
of
these
people
darkens
our
lives
he
is
ready
to
go
we
would
fly
together
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
where
we
would
be
safe
from
them
mcmurdo
laughed
the
lodge
has
a
long
arm
do
you
think
it
could
not
stretch
from
here
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
well
then
to
the
west
or
to
england
or
to
germany
where
father
came
from
anywhere
to
get
away
from
this
valley
of
fear
mcmurdo
thought
of
old
brother
morris
sure
it
is
the
second
time
i
have
heard
the
valley
so
named
said
he
the
shadow
does
indeed
seem
to
lie
heavy
on
some
of
you
it
darkens
every
moment
of
our
lives
do
you
suppose
that
ted
baldwin
has
ever
forgiven
us
if
it
were
not
that
he
fears
you
what
do
you
suppose
our
chances
would
be
if
you
saw
the
look
in
those
dark
hungry
eyes
of
his
when
they
fall
on
me
by
gar
i
d
teach
him
better
manners
if
i
caught
him
at
it
but
see
here
little
girl
i
can
t
leave
here
i
can
t
take
that
from
me
once
and
for
all
but
if
you
will
leave
me
to
find
my
own
way
i
will
try
to
prepare
a
way
of
getting
honourably
out
of
it
there
is
no
honour
in
such
a
matter
well
well
it
s
just
how
you
look
at
it
but
if
you
ll
give
me
six
months
i
ll
work
it
so
that
i
can
leave
without
being
ashamed
to
look
others
in
the
face
the
girl
laughed
with
joy
six
months
she
cried
is
it
a
promise
well
it
may
be
seven
or
eight
but
within
a
year
at
the
furthest
we
will
leave
the
valley
behind
us
it
was
the
most
that
ettie
could
obtain
and
yet
it
was
something
there
was
this
distant
light
to
illuminate
the
gloom
of
the
immediate
future
she
returned
to
her
father
s
house
more
light
hearted
than
she
had
ever
been
since
jack
mcmurdo
had
come
into
her
life
it
might
be
thought
that
as
a
member
all
the
doings
of
the
society
would
be
told
to
him
but
he
was
soon
to
discover
that
the
organization
was
wider
and
more
complex
than
the
simple
lodge
even
boss
mcginty
was
ignorant
as
to
many
things
for
there
was
an
official
named
the
county
delegate
living
at
hobson
s
patch
farther
down
the
line
who
had
power
over
several
different
lodges
which
he
wielded
in
a
sudden
and
arbitrary
way
only
once
did
mcmurdo
see
him
a
sly
little
gray
haired
rat
of
a
man
with
a
slinking
gait
and
a
sidelong
glance
which
was
charged
with
malice
evans
pott
was
his
name
and
even
the
great
boss
of
vermissa
felt
towards
him
something
of
the
repulsion
and
fear
which
the
huge
danton
may
have
felt
for
the
puny
but
dangerous
robespierre
one
day
scanlan
who
was
mcmurdo
s
fellow
boarder
received
a
note
from
mcginty
inclosing
one
from
evans
pott
which
informed
him
that
he
was
sending
over
two
good
men
lawler
and
andrews
who
had
instructions
to
act
in
the
neighbourhood
though
it
was
best
for
the
cause
that
no
particulars
as
to
their
objects
should
be
given
would
the
bodymaster
see
to
it
that
suitable
arrangements
be
made
for
their
lodgings
and
comfort
until
the
time
for
action
should
arrive
mcginty
added
that
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
remain
secret
at
the
union
house
and
that
therefore
he
would
be
obliged
if
mcmurdo
and
scanlan
would
put
the
strangers
up
for
a
few
days
in
their
boarding
house
the
same
evening
the
two
men
arrived
each
carrying
his
gripsack
lawler
was
an
elderly
man
shrewd
silent
and
self
contained
clad
in
an
old
black
frock
coat
which
with
his
soft
felt
hat
and
ragged
grizzled
beard
gave
him
a
general
resemblance
to
an
itinerant
preacher
his
companion
andrews
was
little
more
than
a
boy
frank
faced
and
cheerful
with
the
breezy
manner
of
one
who
is
out
for
a
holiday
and
means
to
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
both
men
were
total
abstainers
and
behaved
in
all
ways
as
exemplary
members
of
the
society
with
the
one
simple
exception
that
they
were
assassins
who
had
often
proved
themselves
to
be
most
capable
instruments
for
this
association
of
murder
lawler
had
already
carried
out
fourteen
commissions
of
the
kind
and
andrews
three
they
were
as
mcmurdo
found
quite
ready
to
converse
about
their
deeds
in
the
past
which
they
recounted
with
the
half
bashful
pride
of
men
who
had
done
good
and
unselfish
service
for
the
community
they
were
reticent
however
as
to
the
immediate
job
in
hand
they
chose
us
because
neither
i
nor
the
boy
here
drink
lawler
explained
they
can
count
on
us
saying
no
more
than
we
should
you
must
not
take
it
amiss
but
it
is
the
orders
of
the
county
delegate
that
we
obey
sure
we
are
all
in
it
together
said
scanlan
mcmurdo
s
mate
as
the
four
sat
together
at
supper
that
s
true
enough
and
we
ll
talk
till
the
cows
come
home
of
the
killing
of
charlie
williams
or
of
simon
bird
or
any
other
job
in
the
past
but
till
the
work
is
done
we
say
nothing
there
are
half
a
dozen
about
here
that
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
said
mcmurdo
with
an
oath
i
suppose
it
isn
t
jack
knox
of
ironhill
that
you
are
after
i
d
go
some
way
to
see
him
get
his
deserts
no
it
s
not
him
yet
or
herman
strauss
no
nor
him
either
well
if
you
won
t
tell
us
we
can
t
make
you
but
i
d
be
glad
to
know
lawler
smiled
and
shook
his
head
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
in
spite
of
the
reticence
of
their
guests
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
were
quite
determined
to
be
present
at
what
they
called
the
fun
when
therefore
at
an
early
hour
one
morning
mcmurdo
heard
them
creeping
down
the
stairs
he
awakened
scanlan
and
the
two
hurried
on
their
clothes
when
they
were
dressed
they
found
that
the
others
had
stolen
out
leaving
the
door
open
behind
them
it
was
not
yet
dawn
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
they
could
see
the
two
men
some
distance
down
the
street
they
followed
them
warily
treading
noiselessly
in
the
deep
snow
the
boarding
house
was
near
the
edge
of
the
town
and
soon
they
were
at
the
crossroads
which
is
beyond
its
boundary
here
three
men
were
waiting
with
whom
lawler
and
andrews
held
a
short
eager
conversation
then
they
all
moved
on
together
it
was
clearly
some
notable
job
which
needed
numbers
at
this
point
there
are
several
trails
which
lead
to
various
mines
the
strangers
took
that
which
led
to
the
crow
hill
a
huge
business
which
was
in
strong
hands
which
had
been
able
thanks
to
their
energetic
and
fearless
new
england
manager
josiah
h
dunn
to
keep
some
order
and
discipline
during
the
long
reign
of
terror
day
was
breaking
now
and
a
line
of
workmen
were
slowly
making
their
way
singly
and
in
groups
along
the
blackened
path
mcmurdo
and
scanlan
strolled
on
with
the
others
keeping
in
sight
of
the
men
whom
they
followed
a
thick
mist
lay
over
them
and
from
the
heart
of
it
there
came
the
sudden
scream
of
a
steam
whistle
it
was
the
ten
minute
signal
before
the
cages
descended
and
the
day
s
labour
began
when
they
reached
the
open
space
round
the
mine
shaft
there
were
a
hundred
miners
waiting
stamping
their
feet
and
blowing
on
their
fingers
for
it
was
bitterly
cold
the
strangers
stood
in
a
little
group
under
the
shadow
of
the
engine
house
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
climbed
a
heap
of
slag
from
which
the
whole
scene
lay
before
them
they
saw
the
mine
engineer
a
great
bearded
scotchman
named
menzies
come
out
of
the
engine
house
and
blow
his
whistle
for
the
cages
to
be
lowered
at
the
same
instant
a
tall
loose
framed
young
man
with
a
clean
shaved
earnest
face
advanced
eagerly
towards
the
pit
head
as
he
came
forward
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
group
silent
and
motionless
under
the
engine
house
the
men
had
drawn
down
their
hats
and
turned
up
their
collars
to
screen
their
faces
for
a
moment
the
presentiment
of
death
laid
its
cold
hand
upon
the
manager
s
heart
at
the
next
he
had
shaken
it
off
and
saw
only
his
duty
towards
intrusive
strangers
who
are
you
he
asked
as
he
advanced
what
are
you
loitering
there
for
there
was
no
answer
but
the
lad
andrews
stepped
forward
and
shot
him
in
the
stomach
the
hundred
waiting
miners
stood
as
motionless
and
helpless
as
if
they
were
paralyzed
the
manager
clapped
his
two
hands
to
the
wound
and
doubled
himself
up
then
he
staggered
away
but
another
of
the
assassins
fired
and
he
went
down
sidewise
kicking
and
clawing
among
a
heap
of
clinkers
menzies
the
scotchman
gave
a
roar
of
rage
at
the
sight
and
rushed
with
an
iron
spanner
at
the
murderers
but
was
met
by
two
balls
in
the
face
which
dropped
him
dead
at
their
very
feet
there
was
a
surge
forward
of
some
of
the
miners
and
an
inarticulate
cry
of
pity
and
of
anger
but
a
couple
of
the
strangers
emptied
their
six
shooters
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
they
broke
and
scattered
some
of
them
rushing
wildly
back
to
their
homes
in
vermissa
when
a
few
of
the
bravest
had
rallied
and
there
was
a
return
to
the
mine
the
murderous
gang
had
vanished
in
the
mists
of
morning
without
a
single
witness
being
able
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
these
men
who
in
front
of
a
hundred
spectators
had
wrought
this
double
crime
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
made
their
way
back
scanlan
somewhat
subdued
for
it
was
the
first
murder
job
that
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
it
appeared
less
funny
than
he
had
been
led
to
believe
the
horrible
screams
of
the
dead
manager
s
wife
pursued
them
as
they
hurried
to
the
town
mcmurdo
was
absorbed
and
silent
but
he
showed
no
sympathy
for
the
weakening
of
his
companion
sure
it
is
like
a
war
he
repeated
what
is
it
but
a
war
between
us
and
them
and
we
hit
back
where
we
best
can
there
was
high
revel
in
the
lodge
room
at
the
union
house
that
night
not
only
over
the
killing
of
the
manager
and
engineer
of
the
crow
hill
mine
which
would
bring
this
organization
into
line
with
the
other
blackmailed
and
terror
stricken
companies
of
the
district
but
also
over
a
distant
triumph
which
had
been
wrought
by
the
hands
of
the
lodge
itself
it
would
appear
that
when
the
county
delegate
had
sent
over
five
good
men
to
strike
a
blow
in
vermissa
he
had
demanded
that
in
return
three
vermissa
men
should
be
secretly
selected
and
sent
across
to
kill
william
hales
of
stake
royal
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
popular
mine
owners
in
the
gilmerton
district
a
man
who
was
believed
not
to
have
an
enemy
in
the
world
for
he
was
in
all
ways
a
model
employer
he
had
insisted
however
upon
efficiency
in
the
work
and
had
therefore
paid
off
certain
drunken
and
idle
employees
who
were
members
of
the
all
powerful
society
coffin
notices
hung
outside
his
door
had
not
weakened
his
resolution
and
so
in
a
free
civilized
country
he
found
himself
condemned
to
death
the
execution
had
now
been
duly
carried
out
ted
baldwin
who
sprawled
now
in
the
seat
of
honour
beside
the
bodymaster
had
been
chief
of
the
party
his
flushed
face
and
glazed
bloodshot
eyes
told
of
sleeplessness
and
drink
he
and
his
two
comrades
had
spent
the
night
before
among
the
mountains
they
were
unkempt
and
weather
stained
but
no
heroes
returning
from
a
forlorn
hope
could
have
had
a
warmer
welcome
from
their
comrades
the
story
was
told
and
retold
amid
cries
of
delight
and
shouts
of
laughter
they
had
waited
for
their
man
as
he
drove
home
at
nightfall
taking
their
station
at
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
where
his
horse
must
be
at
a
walk
he
was
so
furred
to
keep
out
the
cold
that
he
could
not
lay
his
hand
on
his
pistol
they
had
pulled
him
out
and
shot
him
again
and
again
he
had
screamed
for
mercy
the
screams
were
repeated
for
the
amusement
of
the
lodge
let
s
hear
again
how
he
squealed
they
cried
none
of
them
knew
the
man
but
there
is
eternal
drama
in
a
killing
and
they
had
shown
the
scowrers
of
gilmerton
that
the
vermissa
men
were
to
be
relied
upon
there
had
been
one
contretemps
for
a
man
and
his
wife
had
driven
up
while
they
were
still
emptying
their
revolvers
into
the
silent
body
it
had
been
suggested
that
they
should
shoot
them
both
but
they
were
harmless
folk
who
were
not
connected
with
the
mines
so
they
were
sternly
bidden
to
drive
on
and
keep
silent
lest
a
worse
thing
befall
them
and
so
the
blood
mottled
figure
had
been
left
as
a
warning
to
all
such
hard
hearted
employers
and
the
three
noble
avengers
had
hurried
off
into
the
mountains
where
unbroken
nature
comes
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
furnaces
and
the
slag
heaps
here
they
were
safe
and
sound
their
work
well
done
and
the
plaudits
of
their
companions
in
their
ears
it
had
been
a
great
day
for
the
scowrers
the
shadow
had
fallen
even
darker
over
the
valley
but
as
the
wise
general
chooses
the
moment
of
victory
in
which
to
redouble
his
efforts
so
that
his
foes
may
have
no
time
to
steady
themselves
after
disaster
so
boss
mcginty
looking
out
upon
the
scene
of
his
operations
with
his
brooding
and
malicious
eyes
had
devised
a
new
attack
upon
those
who
opposed
him
that
very
night
as
the
half
drunken
company
broke
up
he
touched
mcmurdo
on
the
arm
and
led
him
aside
into
that
inner
room
where
they
had
their
first
interview
see
here
my
lad
said
he
i
ve
got
a
job
that
s
worthy
of
you
at
last
you
ll
have
the
doing
of
it
in
your
own
hands
proud
i
am
to
hear
it
mcmurdo
answered
you
can
take
two
men
with
you
manders
and
reilly
they
have
been
warned
for
service
we
ll
never
be
right
in
this
district
until
chester
wilcox
has
been
settled
and
you
ll
have
the
thanks
of
every
lodge
in
the
coal
fields
if
you
can
down
him
i
ll
do
my
best
anyhow
who
is
he
and
where
shall
i
find
him
mcginty
took
his
eternal
half
chewed
half
smoked
cigar
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
proceeded
to
draw
a
rough
diagram
on
a
page
torn
from
his
notebook
he
s
the
chief
foreman
of
the
iron
dike
company
he
s
a
hard
citizen
an
old
colour
sergeant
of
the
war
all
scars
and
grizzle
we
ve
had
two
tries
at
him
but
had
no
luck
and
jim
carnaway
lost
his
life
over
it
now
it
s
for
you
to
take
it
over
that
s
the
house
all
alone
at
the
iron
dike
crossroad
same
as
you
see
here
on
the
map
without
another
within
earshot
it
s
no
good
by
day
he
s
armed
and
shoots
quick
and
straight
with
no
questions
asked
but
at
night
well
there
he
is
with
his
wife
three
children
and
a
hired
help
you
can
t
pick
or
choose
it
s
all
or
none
if
you
could
get
a
bag
of
blasting
powder
at
the
front
door
with
a
slow
match
to
it
what
s
the
man
done
didn
t
i
tell
you
he
shot
jim
carnaway
why
did
he
shoot
him
what
in
thunder
has
that
to
do
with
you
carnaway
was
about
his
house
at
night
and
he
shot
him
that
s
enough
for
me
and
you
you
ve
got
to
settle
the
thing
right
there
s
these
two
women
and
the
children
do
they
go
up
too
they
have
to
else
how
can
we
get
him
it
seems
hard
on
them
for
they
ve
done
nothing
what
sort
of
fool
s
talk
is
this
do
you
back
out
easy
councillor
easy
what
have
i
ever
said
or
done
that
you
should
think
i
would
be
after
standing
back
from
an
order
of
the
bodymaster
of
my
own
lodge
if
it
s
right
or
if
it
s
wrong
it
s
for
you
to
decide
you
ll
do
it
then
of
course
i
will
do
it
when
well
you
had
best
give
me
a
night
or
two
that
i
may
see
the
house
and
make
my
plans
then
very
good
said
mcginty
shaking
him
by
the
hand
i
leave
it
with
you
it
will
be
a
great
day
when
you
bring
us
the
news
it
s
just
the
last
stroke
that
will
bring
them
all
to
their
knees
mcmurdo
thought
long
and
deeply
over
the
commission
which
had
been
so
suddenly
placed
in
his
hands
the
isolated
house
in
which
chester
wilcox
lived
was
about
five
miles
off
in
an
adjacent
valley
that
very
night
he
started
off
all
alone
to
prepare
for
the
attempt
it
was
daylight
before
he
returned
from
his
reconnaissance
next
day
he
interviewed
his
two
subordinates
manders
and
reilly
reckless
youngsters
who
were
as
elated
as
if
it
were
a
deer
hunt
two
nights
later
they
met
outside
the
town
all
three
armed
and
one
of
them
carrying
a
sack
stuffed
with
the
powder
which
was
used
in
the
quarries
it
was
two
in
the
morning
before
they
came
to
the
lonely
house
the
night
was
a
windy
one
with
broken
clouds
drifting
swiftly
across
the
face
of
a
three
quarter
moon
they
had
been
warned
to
be
on
their
guard
against
bloodhounds
so
they
moved
forward
cautiously
with
their
pistols
cocked
in
their
hands
but
there
was
no
sound
save
the
howling
of
the
wind
and
no
movement
but
the
swaying
branches
above
them
mcmurdo
listened
at
the
door
of
the
lonely
house
but
all
was
still
within
then
he
leaned
the
powder
bag
against
it
ripped
a
hole
in
it
with
his
knife
and
attached
the
fuse
when
it
was
well
alight
he
and
his
two
companions
took
to
their
heels
and
were
some
distance
off
safe
and
snug
in
a
sheltering
ditch
before
the
shattering
roar
of
the
explosion
with
the
low
deep
rumble
of
the
collapsing
building
told
them
that
their
work
was
done
no
cleaner
job
had
ever
been
carried
out
in
the
bloodstained
annals
of
the
society
but
alas
that
work
so
well
organized
and
boldly
carried
out
should
all
have
gone
for
nothing
warned
by
the
fate
of
the
various
victims
and
knowing
that
he
was
marked
down
for
destruction
chester
wilcox
had
moved
himself
and
his
family
only
the
day
before
to
some
safer
and
less
known
quarters
where
a
guard
of
police
should
watch
over
them
it
was
an
empty
house
which
had
been
torn
down
by
the
gunpowder
and
the
grim
old
colour
sergeant
of
the
war
was
still
teaching
discipline
to
the
miners
of
iron
dike
leave
him
to
me
said
mcmurdo
he
s
my
man
and
i
ll
get
him
sure
if
i
have
to
wait
a
year
for
him
a
vote
of
thanks
and
confidence
was
passed
in
full
lodge
and
so
for
the
time
the
matter
ended
when
a
few
weeks
later
it
was
reported
in
the
papers
that
wilcox
had
been
shot
at
from
an
ambuscade
it
was
an
open
secret
that
mcmurdo
was
still
at
work
upon
his
unfinished
job
such
were
the
methods
of
the
society
of
freemen
and
such
were
the
deeds
of
the
scowrers
by
which
they
spread
their
rule
of
fear
over
the
great
and
rich
district
which
was
for
so
long
a
period
haunted
by
their
terrible
presence
why
should
these
pages
be
stained
by
further
crimes
have
i
not
said
enough
to
show
the
men
and
their
methods
these
deeds
are
written
in
history
and
there
are
records
wherein
one
may
read
the
details
of
them
there
one
may
learn
of
the
shooting
of
policemen
hunt
and
evans
because
they
had
ventured
to
arrest
two
members
of
the
society
a
double
outrage
planned
at
the
vermissa
lodge
and
carried
out
in
cold
blood
upon
two
helpless
and
disarmed
men
there
also
one
may
read
of
the
shooting
of
mrs
larbey
when
she
was
nursing
her
husband
who
had
been
beaten
almost
to
death
by
orders
of
boss
mcginty
the
killing
of
the
elder
jenkins
shortly
followed
by
that
of
his
brother
the
mutilation
of
james
murdoch
the
blowing
up
of
the
staphouse
family
and
the
murder
of
the
stendals
all
followed
hard
upon
one
another
in
the
same
terrible
winter
darkly
the
shadow
lay
upon
the
valley
of
fear
the
spring
had
come
with
running
brooks
and
blossoming
trees
there
was
hope
for
all
nature
bound
so
long
in
an
iron
grip
but
nowhere
was
there
any
hope
for
the
men
and
women
who
lived
under
the
yoke
of
the
terror
never
had
the
cloud
above
them
been
so
dark
and
hopeless
as
in
the
early
summer
of
the
year
chapter
danger
it
was
the
height
of
the
reign
of
terror
mcmurdo
who
had
already
been
appointed
inner
deacon
with
every
prospect
of
some
day
succeeding
mcginty
as
bodymaster
was
now
so
necessary
to
the
councils
of
his
comrades
that
nothing
was
done
without
his
help
and
advice
the
more
popular
he
became
however
with
the
freemen
the
blacker
were
the
scowls
which
greeted
him
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
of
vermissa
in
spite
of
their
terror
the
citizens
were
taking
heart
to
band
themselves
together
against
their
oppressors
rumours
had
reached
the
lodge
of
secret
gatherings
in
the
herald
office
and
of
distribution
of
firearms
among
the
law
abiding
people
but
mcginty
and
his
men
were
undisturbed
by
such
reports
they
were
numerous
resolute
and
well
armed
their
opponents
were
scattered
and
powerless
it
would
all
end
as
it
had
done
in
the
past
in
aimless
talk
and
possibly
in
impotent
arrests
so
said
mcginty
mcmurdo
and
all
the
bolder
spirits
it
was
a
saturday
evening
in
may
saturday
was
always
the
lodge
night
and
mcmurdo
was
leaving
his
house
to
attend
it
when
morris
the
weaker
brother
of
the
order
came
to
see
him
his
brow
was
creased
with
care
and
his
kindly
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
can
i
speak
with
you
freely
mr
mcmurdo
sure
i
can
t
forget
that
i
spoke
my
heart
to
you
once
and
that
you
kept
it
to
yourself
even
though
the
boss
himself
came
to
ask
you
about
it
what
else
could
i
do
if
you
trusted
me
it
wasn
t
that
i
agreed
with
what
you
said
i
know
that
well
but
you
are
the
one
that
i
can
speak
to
and
be
safe
i
ve
a
secret
here
he
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
and
it
is
just
burning
the
life
out
of
me
i
wish
it
had
come
to
any
one
of
you
but
me
if
i
tell
it
it
will
mean
murder
for
sure
if
i
don
t
it
may
bring
the
end
of
us
all
god
help
me
but
i
am
near
out
of
my
wits
over
it
mcmurdo
looked
at
the
man
earnestly
he
was
trembling
in
every
limb
he
poured
some
whisky
into
a
glass
and
handed
it
to
him
that
s
the
physic
for
the
likes
of
you
said
he
now
let
me
hear
of
it
morris
drank
and
his
white
face
took
a
tinge
of
colour
i
can
tell
it
to
you
all
in
one
sentence
said
he
there
s
a
detective
on
our
trail
mcmurdo
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
why
man
you
re
crazy
he
said
isn
t
the
place
full
of
police
and
detectives
and
what
harm
did
they
ever
do
us
no
no
it
s
no
man
of
the
district
as
you
say
we
know
them
and
it
is
little
that
they
can
do
but
you
ve
heard
of
pinkerton
s
i
ve
read
of
some
folk
of
that
name
well
you
can
take
it
from
me
you
ve
no
show
when
they
are
on
your
trail
it
s
not
a
take
it
or
miss
it
government
concern
it
s
a
dead
earnest
business
proposition
that
s
out
for
results
and
keeps
out
till
by
hook
or
crook
it
gets
them
if
a
pinkerton
man
is
deep
in
this
business
we
are
all
destroyed
we
must
kill
him
ah
it
s
the
first
thought
that
came
to
you
so
it
will
be
up
at
the
lodge
didn
t
i
say
to
you
that
it
would
end
in
murder
sure
what
is
murder
isn
t
it
common
enough
in
these
parts
it
is
indeed
but
it
s
not
for
me
to
point
out
the
man
that
is
to
be
murdered
i
d
never
rest
easy
again
and
yet
it
s
our
own
necks
that
may
be
at
stake
in
god
s
name
what
shall
i
do
he
rocked
to
and
fro
in
his
agony
of
indecision
but
his
words
had
moved
mcmurdo
deeply
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
shared
the
other
s
opinion
as
to
the
danger
and
the
need
for
meeting
it
he
gripped
morris
s
shoulder
and
shook
him
in
his
earnestness
see
here
man
he
cried
and
he
almost
screeched
the
words
in
his
excitement
you
won
t
gain
anything
by
sitting
keening
like
an
old
wife
at
a
wake
let
s
have
the
facts
who
is
the
fellow
where
is
he
how
did
you
hear
of
him
why
did
you
come
to
me
i
came
to
you
for
you
are
the
one
man
that
would
advise
me
i
told
you
that
i
had
a
store
in
the
east
before
i
came
here
i
left
good
friends
behind
me
and
one
of
them
is
in
the
telegraph
service
here
s
a
letter
that
i
had
from
him
yesterday
it
s
this
part
from
the
top
of
the
page
you
can
read
it
yourself
this
was
what
mcmurdo
read
how
are
the
scowrers
getting
on
in
your
parts
we
read
plenty
of
them
in
the
papers
between
you
and
me
i
expect
to
hear
news
from
you
before
long
five
big
corporations
and
the
two
railroads
have
taken
the
thing
up
in
dead
earnest
they
mean
it
and
you
can
bet
they
ll
get
there
they
are
right
deep
down
into
it
pinkerton
has
taken
hold
under
their
orders
and
his
best
man
birdy
edwards
is
operating
the
thing
has
got
to
be
stopped
right
now
now
read
the
postscript
of
course
what
i
give
you
is
what
i
learned
in
business
so
it
goes
no
further
it
s
a
queer
cipher
that
you
handle
by
the
yard
every
day
and
can
get
no
meaning
from
mcmurdo
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
with
the
letter
in
his
listless
hands
the
mist
had
lifted
for
a
moment
and
there
was
the
abyss
before
him
does
anyone
else
know
of
this
he
asked
i
have
told
no
one
else
but
this
man
your
friend
has
he
any
other
person
that
he
would
be
likely
to
write
to
well
i
dare
say
he
knows
one
or
two
more
of
the
lodge
it
s
likely
enough
i
was
asking
because
it
is
likely
that
he
may
have
given
some
description
of
this
fellow
birdy
edwards
then
we
could
get
on
his
trail
well
it
s
possible
but
i
should
not
think
he
knew
him
he
is
just
telling
me
the
news
that
came
to
him
by
way
of
business
how
would
he
know
this
pinkerton
man
mcmurdo
gave
a
violent
start
by
gar
he
cried
i
ve
got
him
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
know
it
lord
but
we
re
in
luck
we
will
fix
him
before
he
can
do
any
harm
see
here
morris
will
you
leave
this
thing
in
my
hands
sure
if
you
will
only
take
it
off
mine
i
ll
do
that
you
can
stand
right
back
and
let
me
run
it
even
your
name
need
not
be
mentioned
i
ll
take
it
all
on
myself
as
if
it
were
to
me
that
this
letter
has
come
will
that
content
you
it
s
just
what
i
would
ask
then
leave
it
at
that
and
keep
your
head
shut
now
i
ll
get
down
to
the
lodge
and
we
ll
soon
make
old
man
pinkerton
sorry
for
himself
you
wouldn
t
kill
this
man
the
less
you
know
friend
morris
the
easier
your
conscience
will
be
and
the
better
you
will
sleep
ask
no
questions
and
let
these
things
settle
themselves
i
have
hold
of
it
now
morris
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
left
i
feel
that
his
blood
is
on
my
hands
he
groaned
self
protection
is
no
murder
anyhow
said
mcmurdo
smiling
grimly
it
s
him
or
us
i
guess
this
man
would
destroy
us
all
if
we
left
him
long
in
the
valley
why
brother
morris
we
ll
have
to
elect
you
bodymaster
yet
for
you
ve
surely
saved
the
lodge
and
yet
it
was
clear
from
his
actions
that
he
thought
more
seriously
of
this
new
intrusion
than
his
words
would
show
it
may
have
been
his
guilty
conscience
it
may
have
been
the
reputation
of
the
pinkerton
organization
it
may
have
been
the
knowledge
that
great
rich
corporations
had
set
themselves
the
task
of
clearing
out
the
scowrers
but
whatever
his
reason
his
actions
were
those
of
a
man
who
is
preparing
for
the
worst
every
paper
which
would
incriminate
him
was
destroyed
before
he
left
the
house
after
that
he
gave
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
safe
and
yet
the
danger
must
still
have
pressed
somewhat
upon
him
for
on
his
way
to
the
lodge
he
stopped
at
old
man
shafter
s
the
house
was
forbidden
him
but
when
he
tapped
at
the
window
ettie
came
out
to
him
the
dancing
irish
deviltry
had
gone
from
her
lover
s
eyes
she
read
his
danger
in
his
earnest
face
something
has
happened
she
cried
oh
jack
you
are
in
danger
sure
it
is
not
very
bad
my
sweetheart
and
yet
it
may
be
wise
that
we
make
a
move
before
it
is
worse
make
a
move
i
promised
you
once
that
i
would
go
some
day
i
think
the
time
is
coming
i
had
news
to
night
bad
news
and
i
see
trouble
coming
the
police
well
a
pinkerton
but
sure
you
wouldn
t
know
what
that
is
acushla
nor
what
it
may
mean
to
the
likes
of
me
i
m
too
deep
in
this
thing
and
i
may
have
to
get
out
of
it
quick
you
said
you
would
come
with
me
if
i
went
oh
jack
it
would
be
the
saving
of
you
i
m
an
honest
man
in
some
things
ettie
i
wouldn
t
hurt
a
hair
of
your
bonny
head
for
all
that
the
world
can
give
nor
ever
pull
you
down
one
inch
from
the
golden
throne
above
the
clouds
where
i
always
see
you
would
you
trust
me
she
put
her
hand
in
his
without
a
word
well
then
listen
to
what
i
say
and
do
as
i
order
you
for
indeed
it
s
the
only
way
for
us
things
are
going
to
happen
in
this
valley
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
there
may
be
many
of
us
that
will
have
to
look
out
for
ourselves
i
m
one
anyhow
if
i
go
by
day
or
night
it
s
you
that
must
come
with
me
i
d
come
after
you
jack
no
no
you
shall
come
with
me
if
this
valley
is
closed
to
me
and
i
can
never
come
back
how
can
i
leave
you
behind
and
me
perhaps
in
hiding
from
the
police
with
never
a
chance
of
a
message
it
s
with
me
you
must
come
i
know
a
good
woman
in
the
place
i
come
from
and
it
s
there
i
d
leave
you
till
we
can
get
married
will
you
come
yes
jack
i
will
come
god
bless
you
for
your
trust
in
me
it
s
a
fiend
out
of
hell
that
i
should
be
if
i
abused
it
now
mark
you
ettie
it
will
be
just
a
word
to
you
and
when
it
reaches
you
you
will
drop
everything
and
come
right
down
to
the
waiting
room
at
the
depot
and
stay
there
till
i
come
for
you
day
or
night
i
ll
come
at
the
word
jack
somewhat
eased
in
mind
now
that
his
own
preparations
for
escape
had
been
begun
mcmurdo
went
on
to
the
lodge
it
had
already
assembled
and
only
by
complicated
signs
and
countersigns
could
he
pass
through
the
outer
guard
and
inner
guard
who
close
tiled
it
a
buzz
of
pleasure
and
welcome
greeted
him
as
he
entered
the
long
room
was
crowded
and
through
the
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
he
saw
the
tangled
black
mane
of
the
bodymaster
the
cruel
unfriendly
features
of
baldwin
the
vulture
face
of
harraway
the
secretary
and
a
dozen
more
who
were
among
the
leaders
of
the
lodge
he
rejoiced
that
they
should
all
be
there
to
take
counsel
over
his
news
indeed
it
s
glad
we
are
to
see
you
brother
cried
the
chairman
there
s
business
here
that
wants
a
solomon
in
judgment
to
set
it
right
it
s
lander
and
egan
explained
his
neighbour
as
he
took
his
seat
they
both
claim
the
head
money
given
by
the
lodge
for
the
shooting
of
old
man
crabbe
over
at
stylestown
and
who
s
to
say
which
fired
the
bullet
mcmurdo
rose
in
his
place
and
raised
his
hand
the
expression
of
his
face
froze
the
attention
of
the
audience
there
was
a
dead
hush
of
expectation
eminent
bodymaster
he
said
in
a
solemn
voice
i
claim
urgency
brother
mcmurdo
claims
urgency
said
mcginty
it
s
a
claim
that
by
the
rules
of
this
lodge
takes
precedence
now
brother
we
attend
you
mcmurdo
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
eminent
bodymaster
and
brethren
he
said
i
am
the
bearer
of
ill
news
this
day
but
it
is
better
that
it
should
be
known
and
discussed
than
that
a
blow
should
fall
upon
us
without
warning
which
would
destroy
us
all
i
have
information
that
the
most
powerful
and
richest
organizations
in
this
state
have
bound
themselves
together
for
our
destruction
and
that
at
this
very
moment
there
is
a
pinkerton
detective
one
birdy
edwards
at
work
in
the
valley
collecting
the
evidence
which
may
put
a
rope
round
the
necks
of
many
of
us
and
send
every
man
in
this
room
into
a
felon
s
cell
that
is
the
situation
for
the
discussion
of
which
i
have
made
a
claim
of
urgency
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
it
was
broken
by
the
chairman
what
is
your
evidence
for
this
brother
mcmurdo
he
asked
it
is
in
this
letter
which
has
come
into
my
hands
said
mcmurdo
he
read
the
passage
aloud
it
is
a
matter
of
honour
with
me
that
i
can
give
no
further
particulars
about
the
letter
nor
put
it
into
your
hands
but
i
assure
you
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
it
which
can
affect
the
interests
of
the
lodge
i
put
the
case
before
you
as
it
has
reached
me
let
me
say
mr
chairman
said
one
of
the
older
brethren
that
i
have
heard
of
birdy
edwards
and
that
he
has
the
name
of
being
the
best
man
in
the
pinkerton
service
does
anyone
know
him
by
sight
asked
mcginty
yes
said
mcmurdo
i
do
there
was
a
murmur
of
astonishment
through
the
hall
i
believe
we
hold
him
in
the
hollow
of
our
hands
he
continued
with
an
exulting
smile
upon
his
face
if
we
act
quickly
and
wisely
we
can
cut
this
thing
short
if
i
have
your
confidence
and
your
help
it
is
little
that
we
have
to
fear
what
have
we
to
fear
anyhow
what
can
he
know
of
our
affairs
you
might
say
so
if
all
were
as
stanch
as
you
councillor
but
this
man
has
all
the
millions
of
the
capitalists
at
his
back
do
you
think
there
is
no
weaker
brother
among
all
our
lodges
that
could
not
be
bought
he
will
get
at
our
secrets
maybe
has
got
them
already
there
s
only
one
sure
cure
that
he
never
leaves
the
valley
said
baldwin
mcmurdo
nodded
good
for
you
brother
baldwin
he
said
you
and
i
have
had
our
differences
but
you
have
said
the
true
word
to
night
where
is
he
then
where
shall
we
know
him
eminent
bodymaster
said
mcmurdo
earnestly
i
would
put
it
to
you
that
this
is
too
vital
a
thing
for
us
to
discuss
in
open
lodge
god
forbid
that
i
should
throw
a
doubt
on
anyone
here
but
if
so
much
as
a
word
of
gossip
got
to
the
ears
of
this
man
there
would
be
an
end
of
any
chance
of
our
getting
him
i
would
ask
the
lodge
to
choose
a
trusty
committee
mr
chairman
yourself
if
i
might
suggest
it
and
brother
baldwin
here
and
five
more
then
i
can
talk
freely
of
what
i
know
and
of
what
i
advise
should
be
done
the
proposition
was
at
once
adopted
and
the
committee
chosen
besides
the
chairman
and
baldwin
there
were
the
vulture
faced
secretary
harraway
tiger
cormac
the
brutal
young
assassin
carter
the
treasurer
and
the
brothers
willaby
fearless
and
desperate
men
who
would
stick
at
nothing
the
usual
revelry
of
the
lodge
was
short
and
subdued
for
there
was
a
cloud
upon
the
men
s
spirits
and
many
there
for
the
first
time
began
to
see
the
cloud
of
avenging
law
drifting
up
in
that
serene
sky
under
which
they
had
dwelt
so
long
the
horrors
they
had
dealt
out
to
others
had
been
so
much
a
part
of
their
settled
lives
that
the
thought
of
retribution
had
become
a
remote
one
and
so
seemed
the
more
startling
now
that
it
came
so
closely
upon
them
they
broke
up
early
and
left
their
leaders
to
their
council
now
mcmurdo
said
mcginty
when
they
were
alone
the
seven
men
sat
frozen
in
their
seats
i
said
just
now
that
i
knew
birdy
edwards
mcmurdo
explained
i
need
not
tell
you
that
he
is
not
here
under
that
name
he
s
a
brave
man
but
not
a
crazy
one
he
passes
under
the
name
of
steve
wilson
and
he
is
lodging
at
hobson
s
patch
how
do
you
know
this
because
i
fell
into
talk
with
him
i
thought
little
of
it
at
the
time
nor
would
have
given
it
a
second
thought
but
for
this
letter
but
now
i
m
sure
it
s
the
man
i
met
him
on
the
cars
when
i
went
down
the
line
on
wednesday
a
hard
case
if
ever
there
was
one
he
said
he
was
a
reporter
i
believed
it
for
the
moment
wanted
to
know
all
he
could
about
the
scowrers
and
what
he
called
the
outrages
for
a
new
york
paper
asked
me
every
kind
of
question
so
as
to
get
something
you
bet
i
was
giving
nothing
away
i
d
pay
for
it
and
pay
well
said
he
if
i
could
get
some
stuff
that
would
suit
my
editor
i
said
what
i
thought
would
please
him
best
and
he
handed
me
a
twenty
dollar
bill
for
my
information
there
s
ten
times
that
for
you
said
he
if
you
can
find
me
all
that
i
want
what
did
you
tell
him
then
any
stuff
i
could
make
up
how
do
you
know
he
wasn
t
a
newspaper
man
i
ll
tell
you
he
got
out
at
hobson
s
patch
and
so
did
i
i
chanced
into
the
telegraph
bureau
and
he
was
leaving
it
see
here
said
the
operator
after
he
d
gone
out
i
guess
we
should
charge
double
rates
for
this
i
guess
you
should
said
i
he
had
filled
the
form
with
stuff
that
might
have
been
chinese
for
all
we
could
make
of
it
he
fires
a
sheet
of
this
off
every
day
said
the
clerk
yes
said
i
it
s
special
news
for
his
paper
and
he
s
scared
that
the
others
should
tap
it
that
was
what
the
operator
thought
and
what
i
thought
at
the
time
but
i
think
differently
now
by
gar
i
believe
you
are
right
said
mcginty
but
what
do
you
allow
that
we
should
do
about
it
why
not
go
right
down
now
and
fix
him
someone
suggested
ay
the
sooner
the
better
i
d
start
this
next
minute
if
i
knew
where
we
could
find
him
said
mcmurdo
he
s
in
hobson
s
patch
but
i
don
t
know
the
house
i
ve
got
a
plan
though
if
you
ll
only
take
my
advice
well
what
is
it
i
ll
go
to
the
patch
to
morrow
morning
i
ll
find
him
through
the
operator
he
can
locate
him
i
guess
well
then
i
ll
tell
him
that
i
m
a
freeman
myself
i
ll
offer
him
all
the
secrets
of
the
lodge
for
a
price
you
bet
he
ll
tumble
to
it
i
ll
tell
him
the
papers
are
at
my
house
and
that
it
s
as
much
as
my
life
would
be
worth
to
let
him
come
while
folk
were
about
he
ll
see
that
that
s
horse
sense
let
him
come
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
and
he
shall
see
everything
that
will
fetch
him
sure
well
you
can
plan
the
rest
for
yourselves

as
true
as
steel
and
as
deaf
as
a
post

the
house

door

and

rest
with

chapter
the
trapping
of
birdy
edwards
as
mcmurdo
had
said
the
house
in
which
he
lived
was
a
lonely
one
and
very
well
suited
for
such
a
crime
as
they
had
planned
it
was
on
the
extreme
fringe
of
the
town
and
stood
well
back
from
the
road
in
any
other
case
the
conspirators
would
have
simply
called
out
their
man
as
they
had
many
a
time
before
and
emptied
their
pistols
into
his
body
but
in
this
instance
it
was
very
necessary
to
find
out
how
much
he
knew
how
he
knew
it
and
what
had
been
passed
on
to
his
employers
it
was
possible
that
they
were
already
too
late
and
that
the
work
had
been
done
if
that
was
indeed
so
they
could
at
least
have
their
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
done
it
but
they
were
hopeful
that
nothing
of
great
importance
had
yet
come
to
the
detective
s
knowledge
as
otherwise
they
argued
he
would
not
have
troubled
to
write
down
and
forward
such
trivial
information
as
mcmurdo
claimed
to
have
given
him
however
all
this
they
would
learn
from
his
own
lips
once
in
their
power
they
would
find
a
way
to
make
him
speak
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
they
had
handled
an
unwilling
witness
mcmurdo
went
to
hobson
s
patch
as
agreed
the
police
seemed
to
take
particular
interest
in
him
that
morning
and
captain
marvin
he
who
had
claimed
the
old
acquaintance
with
him
at
chicago
actually
addressed
him
as
he
waited
at
the
station
mcmurdo
turned
away
and
refused
to
speak
with
him
he
was
back
from
his
mission
in
the
afternoon
and
saw
mcginty
at
the
union
house
he
is
coming
he
said
good
said
mcginty
the
giant
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
chains
and
seals
gleaming
athwart
his
ample
waistcoat
and
a
diamond
twinkling
through
the
fringe
of
his
bristling
beard
drink
and
politics
had
made
the
boss
a
very
rich
as
well
as
powerful
man
the
more
terrible
therefore
seemed
that
glimpse
of
the
prison
or
the
gallows
which
had
risen
before
him
the
night
before
do
you
reckon
he
knows
much
he
asked
anxiously
mcmurdo
shook
his
head
gloomily
he
s
been
here
some
time
six
weeks
at
the
least
i
guess
he
didn
t
come
into
these
parts
to
look
at
the
prospect
if
he
has
been
working
among
us
all
that
time
with
the
railroad
money
at
his
back
i
should
expect
that
he
has
got
results
and
that
he
has
passed
them
on
there
s
not
a
weak
man
in
the
lodge
cried
mcginty
true
as
steel
every
man
of
them
and
yet
by
the
lord
there
is
that
skunk
morris
what
about
him
if
any
man
gives
us
away
it
would
be
he
i
ve
a
mind
to
send
a
couple
of
the
boys
round
before
evening
to
give
him
a
beating
up
and
see
what
they
can
get
from
him
well
there
would
be
no
harm
in
that
mcmurdo
answered
i
won
t
deny
that
i
have
a
liking
for
morris
and
would
be
sorry
to
see
him
come
to
harm
he
has
spoken
to
me
once
or
twice
over
lodge
matters
and
though
he
may
not
see
them
the
same
as
you
or
i
he
never
seemed
the
sort
that
squeals
but
still
it
is
not
for
me
to
stand
between
him
and
you
i
ll
fix
the
old
devil
said
mcginty
with
an
oath
i
ve
had
my
eye
on
him
this
year
past
well
you
know
best
about
that
mcmurdo
answered
but
whatever
you
do
must
be
to
morrow
for
we
must
lie
low
until
the
pinkerton
affair
is
settled
up
we
can
t
afford
to
set
the
police
buzzing
to
day
of
all
days
true
for
you
said
mcginty
and
we
ll
learn
from
birdy
edwards
himself
where
he
got
his
news
if
we
have
to
cut
his
heart
out
first
did
he
seem
to
scent
a
trap
mcmurdo
laughed
i
guess
i
took
him
on
his
weak
point
he
said
if
he
could
get
on
a
good
trail
of
the
scowrers
he
s
ready
to
follow
it
into
hell
i
took
his
money
mcmurdo
grinned
as
he
produced
a
wad
of
dollar
notes
and
as
much
more
when
he
has
seen
all
my
papers
what
papers
well
there
are
no
papers
but
i
filled
him
up
about
constitutions
and
books
of
rules
and
forms
of
membership
he
expects
to
get
right
down
to
the
end
of
everything
before
he
leaves
faith
he
s
right
there
said
mcginty
grimly
didn
t
he
ask
you
why
you
didn
t
bring
him
the
papers
as
if
i
would
carry
such
things
and
me
a
suspected
man
and
captain
marvin
after
speaking
to
me
this
very
day
at
the
depot
ay
i
heard
of
that
said
mcginty
i
guess
the
heavy
end
of
this
business
is
coming
on
to
you
we
could
put
him
down
an
old
shaft
when
we
ve
done
with
him
but
however
we
work
it
we
can
t
get
past
the
man
living
at
hobson
s
patch
and
you
being
there
to
day
mcmurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
we
handle
it
right
they
can
never
prove
the
killing
said
he
no
one
can
see
him
come
to
the
house
after
dark
and
i
ll
lay
to
it
that
no
one
will
see
him
go
now
see
here
councillor
i
ll
show
you
my
plan
and
i
ll
ask
you
to
fit
the
others
into
it
you
will
all
come
in
good
time
very
well
he
comes
at
ten
he
is
to
tap
three
times
and
me
to
open
the
door
for
him
then
i
ll
get
behind
him
and
shut
it
he
s
our
man
then
that
s
all
easy
and
plain
yes
but
the
next
step
wants
considering
he
s
a
hard
proposition
he
s
heavily
armed
i
ve
fooled
him
proper
and
yet
he
is
likely
to
be
on
his
guard
suppose
i
show
him
right
into
a
room
with
seven
men
in
it
where
he
expected
to
find
me
alone
there
is
going
to
be
shooting
and
somebody
is
going
to
be
hurt
that
s
so
and
the
noise
is
going
to
bring
every
damned
copper
in
the
township
on
top
of
it
i
guess
you
are
right
this
is
how
i
should
work
it
you
will
all
be
in
the
big
room
same
as
you
saw
when
you
had
a
chat
with
me
i
ll
open
the
door
for
him
show
him
into
the
parlour
beside
the
door
and
leave
him
there
while
i
get
the
papers
that
will
give
me
the
chance
of
telling
you
how
things
are
shaping
then
i
will
go
back
to
him
with
some
faked
papers
as
he
is
reading
them
i
will
jump
for
him
and
get
my
grip
on
his
pistol
arm
you
ll
hear
me
call
and
in
you
will
rush
the
quicker
the
better
for
he
is
as
strong
a
man
as
i
and
i
may
have
more
than
i
can
manage
but
i
allow
that
i
can
hold
him
till
you
come
it
s
a
good
plan
said
mcginty
the
lodge
will
owe
you
a
debt
for
this
i
guess
when
i
move
out
of
the
chair
i
can
put
a
name
to
the
man
that
s
coming
after
me
sure
councillor
i
am
little
more
than
a
recruit
said
mcmurdo
but
his
face
showed
what
he
thought
of
the
great
man
s
compliment
when
he
had
returned
home
he
made
his
own
preparations
for
the
grim
evening
in
front
of
him
first
he
cleaned
oiled
and
loaded
his
smith
wesson
revolver
then
he
surveyed
the
room
in
which
the
detective
was
to
be
trapped
it
was
a
large
apartment
with
a
long
deal
table
in
the
centre
and
the
big
stove
at
one
side
at
each
of
the
other
sides
were
windows
there
were
no
shutters
on
these
only
light
curtains
which
drew
across
mcmurdo
examined
these
attentively
no
doubt
it
must
have
struck
him
that
the
apartment
was
very
exposed
for
so
secret
a
meeting
yet
its
distance
from
the
road
made
it
of
less
consequence
finally
he
discussed
the
matter
with
his
fellow
lodger
scanlan
though
a
scowrer
was
an
inoffensive
little
man
who
was
too
weak
to
stand
against
the
opinion
of
his
comrades
but
was
secretly
horrified
by
the
deeds
of
blood
at
which
he
had
sometimes
been
forced
to
assist
mcmurdo
told
him
shortly
what
was
intended
and
if
i
were
you
mike
scanlan
i
would
take
a
night
off
and
keep
clear
of
it
there
will
be
bloody
work
here
before
morning
well
indeed
then
mac
scanlan
answered
it
s
not
the
will
but
the
nerve
that
is
wanting
in
me
when
i
saw
manager
dunn
go
down
at
the
colliery
yonder
it
was
just
more
than
i
could
stand
i
m
not
made
for
it
same
as
you
or
mcginty
if
the
lodge
will
think
none
the
worse
of
me
i
ll
just
do
as
you
advise
and
leave
you
to
yourselves
for
the
evening
the
men
came
in
good
time
as
arranged
they
were
outwardly
respectable
citizens
well
clad
and
cleanly
but
a
judge
of
faces
would
have
read
little
hope
for
birdy
edwards
in
those
hard
mouths
and
remorseless
eyes
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
room
whose
hands
had
not
been
reddened
a
dozen
times
before
they
were
as
hardened
to
human
murder
as
a
butcher
to
sheep
foremost
of
course
both
in
appearance
and
in
guilt
was
the
formidable
boss
harraway
the
secretary
was
a
lean
bitter
man
with
a
long
scraggy
neck
and
nervous
jerky
limbs
a
man
of
incorruptible
fidelity
where
the
finances
of
the
order
were
concerned
and
with
no
notion
of
justice
or
honesty
to
anyone
beyond
the
treasurer
carter
was
a
middle
aged
man
with
an
impassive
rather
sulky
expression
and
a
yellow
parchment
skin
he
was
a
capable
organizer
and
the
actual
details
of
nearly
every
outrage
had
sprung
from
his
plotting
brain
the
two
willabys
were
men
of
action
tall
lithe
young
fellows
with
determined
faces
while
their
companion
tiger
cormac
a
heavy
dark
youth
was
feared
even
by
his
own
comrades
for
the
ferocity
of
his
disposition
these
were
the
men
who
assembled
that
night
under
the
roof
of
mcmurdo
for
the
killing
of
the
pinkerton
detective
their
host
had
placed
whisky
upon
the
table
and
they
had
hastened
to
prime
themselves
for
the
work
before
them
baldwin
and
cormac
were
already
half
drunk
and
the
liquor
had
brought
out
all
their
ferocity
cormac
placed
his
hands
on
the
stove
for
an
instant
it
had
been
lighted
for
the
nights
were
still
cold
that
will
do
said
he
with
an
oath
ay
said
baldwin
catching
his
meaning
if
he
is
strapped
to
that
we
will
have
the
truth
out
of
him
we
ll
have
the
truth
out
of
him
never
fear
said
mcmurdo
he
had
nerves
of
steel
this
man
for
though
the
whole
weight
of
the
affair
was
on
him
his
manner
was
as
cool
and
unconcerned
as
ever
the
others
marked
it
and
applauded
you
are
the
one
to
handle
him
said
the
boss
approvingly
not
a
warning
will
he
get
till
your
hand
is
on
his
throat
it
s
a
pity
there
are
no
shutters
to
your
windows
mcmurdo
went
from
one
to
the
other
and
drew
the
curtains
tighter
sure
no
one
can
spy
upon
us
now
it
s
close
upon
the
hour
maybe
he
won
t
come
maybe
he
ll
get
a
sniff
of
danger
said
the
secretary
he
ll
come
never
fear
mcmurdo
answered
he
is
as
eager
to
come
as
you
can
be
to
see
him
hark
to
that
they
all
sat
like
wax
figures
some
with
their
glasses
arrested
halfway
to
their
lips
three
loud
knocks
had
sounded
at
the
door
hush
mcmurdo
raised
his
hand
in
caution
an
exulting
glance
went
round
the
circle
and
hands
were
laid
upon
their
weapons
not
a
sound
for
your
lives
mcmurdo
whispered
as
he
went
from
the
room
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
with
strained
ears
the
murderers
waited
they
counted
the
steps
of
their
comrade
down
the
passage
then
they
heard
him
open
the
outer
door
there
were
a
few
words
as
of
greeting
then
they
were
aware
of
a
strange
step
inside
and
of
an
unfamiliar
voice
an
instant
later
came
the
slam
of
the
door
and
the
turning
of
the
key
in
the
lock
their
prey
was
safe
within
the
trap
tiger
cormac
laughed
horribly
and
boss
mcginty
clapped
his
great
hand
across
his
mouth
be
quiet
you
fool
he
whispered
you
ll
be
the
undoing
of
us
yet
there
was
a
mutter
of
conversation
from
the
next
room
it
seemed
interminable
then
the
door
opened
and
mcmurdo
appeared
his
finger
upon
his
lip
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
looked
round
at
them
a
subtle
change
had
come
over
him
his
manner
was
as
of
one
who
has
great
work
to
do
his
face
had
set
into
granite
firmness
his
eyes
shone
with
a
fierce
excitement
behind
his
spectacles
he
had
become
a
visible
leader
of
men
they
stared
at
him
with
eager
interest
but
he
said
nothing
still
with
the
same
singular
gaze
he
looked
from
man
to
man
well
cried
boss
mcginty
at
last
is
he
here
is
birdy
edwards
here
yes
mcmurdo
answered
slowly
birdy
edwards
is
here
i
am
birdy
edwards
there
were
ten
seconds
after
that
brief
speech
during
which
the
room
might
have
been
empty
so
profound
was
the
silence
the
hissing
of
a
kettle
upon
the
stove
rose
sharp
and
strident
to
the
ear
seven
white
faces
all
turned
upward
to
this
man
who
dominated
them
were
set
motionless
with
utter
terror
then
with
a
sudden
shivering
of
glass
a
bristle
of
glistening
rifle
barrels
broke
through
each
window
while
the
curtains
were
torn
from
their
hangings
at
the
sight
boss
mcginty
gave
the
roar
of
a
wounded
bear
and
plunged
for
the
half
opened
door
a
levelled
revolver
met
him
there
with
the
stern
blue
eyes
of
captain
marvin
of
the
mine
police
gleaming
behind
the
sights
the
boss
recoiled
and
fell
back
into
his
chair
you
re
safer
there
councillor
said
the
man
whom
they
had
known
as
mcmurdo
and
you
baldwin
if
you
don
t
take
your
hand
off
your
pistol
you
ll
cheat
the
hangman
yet
pull
it
out
or
by
the
lord
that
made
me
there
that
will
do
there
are
forty
armed
men
round
this
house
and
you
can
figure
it
out
for
yourself
what
chance
you
have
take
their
pistols
marvin
there
was
no
possible
resistance
under
the
menace
of
those
rifles
the
men
were
disarmed
sulky
sheepish
and
amazed
they
still
sat
round
the
table
i
d
like
to
say
a
word
to
you
before
we
separate
said
the
man
who
had
trapped
them
i
guess
we
may
not
meet
again
until
you
see
me
on
the
stand
in
the
courthouse
i
ll
give
you
something
to
think
over
between
now
and
then
you
know
me
now
for
what
i
am
at
last
i
can
put
my
cards
on
the
table
i
am
birdy
edwards
of
pinkerton
s
i
was
chosen
to
break
up
your
gang
i
had
a
hard
and
dangerous
game
to
play
not
a
soul
not
one
soul
not
my
nearest
and
dearest
knew
that
i
was
playing
it
only
captain
marvin
here
and
my
employers
knew
that
but
it
s
over
to
night
thank
god
and
i
am
the
winner
the
seven
pale
rigid
faces
looked
up
at
him
there
was
unappeasable
hatred
in
their
eyes
he
read
the
relentless
threat
maybe
you
think
that
the
game
is
not
over
yet
well
i
take
my
chance
of
that
anyhow
some
of
you
will
take
no
further
hand
and
there
are
sixty
more
besides
yourselves
that
will
see
a
jail
this
night
i
ll
tell
you
this
that
when
i
was
put
upon
this
job
i
never
believed
there
was
such
a
society
as
yours
i
thought
it
was
paper
talk
and
that
i
would
prove
it
so
they
told
me
it
was
to
do
with
the
freemen
so
i
went
to
chicago
and
was
made
one
then
i
was
surer
than
ever
that
it
was
just
paper
talk
for
i
found
no
harm
in
the
society
but
a
deal
of
good
still
i
had
to
carry
out
my
job
and
i
came
to
the
coal
valleys
when
i
reached
this
place
i
learned
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
it
wasn
t
a
dime
novel
after
all
so
i
stayed
to
look
after
it
i
never
killed
a
man
in
chicago
i
never
minted
a
dollar
in
my
life
those
i
gave
you
were
as
good
as
any
others
but
i
never
spent
money
better
but
i
knew
the
way
into
your
good
wishes
and
so
i
pretended
to
you
that
the
law
was
after
me
it
all
worked
just
as
i
thought
so
i
joined
your
infernal
lodge
and
i
took
my
share
in
your
councils
maybe
they
will
say
that
i
was
as
bad
as
you
they
can
say
what
they
like
so
long
as
i
get
you
but
what
is
the
truth
the
night
i
joined
you
beat
up
old
man
stanger
i
could
not
warn
him
for
there
was
no
time
but
i
held
your
hand
baldwin
when
you
would
have
killed
him
if
ever
i
have
suggested
things
so
as
to
keep
my
place
among
you
they
were
things
which
i
knew
i
could
prevent
i
could
not
save
dunn
and
menzies
for
i
did
not
know
enough
but
i
will
see
that
their
murderers
are
hanged
i
gave
chester
wilcox
warning
so
that
when
i
blew
his
house
in
he
and
his
folk
were
in
hiding
there
was
many
a
crime
that
i
could
not
stop
but
if
you
look
back
and
think
how
often
your
man
came
home
the
other
road
or
was
down
in
town
when
you
went
for
him
or
stayed
indoors
when
you
thought
he
would
come
out
you
ll
see
my
work
you
blasted
traitor
hissed
mcginty
through
his
closed
teeth
ay
john
mcginty
you
may
call
me
that
if
it
eases
your
smart
you
and
your
like
have
been
the
enemy
of
god
and
man
in
these
parts
it
took
a
man
to
get
between
you
and
the
poor
devils
of
men
and
women
that
you
held
under
your
grip
there
was
just
one
way
of
doing
it
and
i
did
it
you
call
me
a
traitor
but
i
guess
there
s
many
a
thousand
will
call
me
a
deliverer
that
went
down
into
hell
to
save
them
i
ve
had
three
months
of
it
i
wouldn
t
have
three
such
months
again
if
they
let
me
loose
in
the
treasury
at
washington
for
it
i
had
to
stay
till
i
had
it
all
every
man
and
every
secret
right
here
in
this
hand
i
d
have
waited
a
little
longer
if
it
hadn
t
come
to
my
knowledge
that
my
secret
was
coming
out
a
letter
had
come
into
the
town
that
would
have
set
you
wise
to
it
all
then
i
had
to
act
and
act
quickly
i
ve
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
except
that
when
my
time
comes
i
ll
die
the
easier
when
i
think
of
the
work
i
have
done
in
this
valley
now
marvin
i
ll
keep
you
no
more
take
them
in
and
get
it
over
there
is
little
more
to
tell
scanlan
had
been
given
a
sealed
note
to
be
left
at
the
address
of
miss
ettie
shafter
a
mission
which
he
had
accepted
with
a
wink
and
a
knowing
smile
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
a
beautiful
woman
and
a
much
muffled
man
boarded
a
special
train
which
had
been
sent
by
the
railroad
company
and
made
a
swift
unbroken
journey
out
of
the
land
of
danger
it
was
the
last
time
that
ever
either
ettie
or
her
lover
set
foot
in
the
valley
of
fear
ten
days
later
they
were
married
in
chicago
with
old
jacob
shafter
as
witness
of
the
wedding
the
trial
of
the
scowrers
was
held
far
from
the
place
where
their
adherents
might
have
terrified
the
guardians
of
the
law
in
vain
they
struggled
in
vain
the
money
of
the
lodge
money
squeezed
by
blackmail
out
of
the
whole
countryside
was
spent
like
water
in
the
attempt
to
save
them
that
cold
clear
unimpassioned
statement
from
one
who
knew
every
detail
of
their
lives
their
organization
and
their
crimes
was
unshaken
by
all
the
wiles
of
their
defenders
at
last
after
so
many
years
they
were
broken
and
scattered
the
cloud
was
lifted
forever
from
the
valley
mcginty
met
his
fate
upon
the
scaffold
cringing
and
whining
when
the
last
hour
came
eight
of
his
chief
followers
shared
his
fate
fifty
odd
had
various
degrees
of
imprisonment
the
work
of
birdy
edwards
was
complete
and
yet
as
he
had
guessed
the
game
was
not
over
yet
there
was
another
hand
to
be
played
and
yet
another
and
another
ted
baldwin
for
one
had
escaped
the
scaffold
so
had
the
willabys
so
had
several
others
of
the
fiercest
spirits
of
the
gang
for
ten
years
they
were
out
of
the
world
and
then
came
a
day
when
they
were
free
once
more
a
day
which
edwards
who
knew
his
men
was
very
sure
would
be
an
end
of
his
life
of
peace
they
had
sworn
an
oath
on
all
that
they
thought
holy
to
have
his
blood
as
a
vengeance
for
their
comrades
and
well
they
strove
to
keep
their
vow
from
chicago
he
was
chased
after
two
attempts
so
near
success
that
it
was
sure
that
the
third
would
get
him
from
chicago
he
went
under
a
changed
name
to
california
and
it
was
there
that
the
light
went
for
a
time
out
of
his
life
when
ettie
edwards
died
once
again
he
was
nearly
killed
and
once
again
under
the
name
of
douglas
he
worked
in
a
lonely
canyon
where
with
an
english
partner
named
barker
he
amassed
a
fortune
at
last
there
came
a
warning
to
him
that
the
bloodhounds
were
on
his
track
once
more
and
he
cleared
only
just
in
time
for
england
and
thence
came
the
john
douglas
who
for
a
second
time
married
a
worthy
mate
and
lived
for
five
years
as
a
sussex
county
gentleman
a
life
which
ended
with
the
strange
happenings
of
which
we
have
heard
epilogue
the
police
trial
had
passed
in
which
the
case
of
john
douglas
was
referred
to
a
higher
court
so
had
the
quarter
sessions
at
which
he
was
acquitted
as
having
acted
in
self
defense
get
him
out
of
england
at
any
cost
wrote
holmes
to
the
wife
there
are
forces
here
which
may
be
more
dangerous
than
those
he
has
escaped
there
is
no
safety
for
your
husband
in
england
two
months
had
gone
by
and
the
case
had
to
some
extent
passed
from
our
minds
then
one
morning
there
came
an
enigmatic
note
slipped
into
our
letter
box
dear
me
mr
holmes
dear
me
said
this
singular
epistle
there
was
neither
superscription
nor
signature
i
laughed
at
the
quaint
message
but
holmes
showed
unwonted
seriousness
deviltry
watson
he
remarked
and
sat
long
with
a
clouded
brow
late
last
night
mrs
hudson
our
landlady
brought
up
a
message
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
mr
holmes
and
that
the
matter
was
of
the
utmost
importance
close
at
the
heels
of
his
messenger
came
cecil
barker
our
friend
of
the
moated
manor
house
his
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
i
ve
had
bad
news
terrible
news
mr
holmes
said
he
i
feared
as
much
said
holmes
you
have
not
had
a
cable
have
you
i
have
had
a
note
from
someone
who
has
it
s
poor
douglas
they
tell
me
his
name
is
edwards
but
he
will
always
be
jack
douglas
of
benito
canyon
to
me
i
told
you
that
they
started
together
for
south
africa
in
the
palmyra
three
weeks
ago
exactly
the
ship
reached
cape
town
last
night
i
received
this
cable
from
mrs
douglas
this
morning
jack
has
been
lost
overboard
in
gale
off
st
helena
no
one
knows
how
accident
occurred
ivy
douglas
ha
it
came
like
that
did
it
said
holmes
thoughtfully
well
i
ve
no
doubt
it
was
well
stage
managed
you
mean
that
you
think
there
was
no
accident
none
in
the
world
he
was
murdered
surely
so
i
think
also
these
infernal
scowrers
this
cursed
vindictive
nest
of
criminals
no
no
my
good
sir
said
holmes
there
is
a
master
hand
here
it
is
no
case
of
sawed
off
shotguns
and
clumsy
six
shooters
you
can
tell
an
old
master
by
the
sweep
of
his
brush
i
can
tell
a
moriarty
when
i
see
one
this
crime
is
from
london
not
from
america
but
for
what
motive
because
it
is
done
by
a
man
who
cannot
afford
to
fail
one
whose
whole
unique
position
depends
upon
the
fact
that
all
he
does
must
succeed
a
great
brain
and
a
huge
organization
have
been
turned
to
the
extinction
of
one
man
it
is
crushing
the
nut
with
the
triphammer
an
absurd
extravagance
of
energy
but
the
nut
is
very
effectually
crushed
all
the
same
how
came
this
man
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
can
only
say
that
the
first
word
that
ever
came
to
us
of
the
business
was
from
one
of
his
lieutenants
these
americans
were
well
advised
having
an
english
job
to
do
they
took
into
partnership
as
any
foreign
criminal
could
do
this
great
consultant
in
crime
from
that
moment
their
man
was
doomed
at
first
he
would
content
himself
by
using
his
machinery
in
order
to
find
their
victim
then
he
would
indicate
how
the
matter
might
be
treated
finally
when
he
read
in
the
reports
of
the
failure
of
this
agent
he
would
step
in
himself
with
a
master
touch
you
heard
me
warn
this
man
at
birlstone
manor
house
that
the
coming
danger
was
greater
than
the
past
was
i
right
barker
beat
his
head
with
his
clenched
fist
in
his
impotent
anger
do
not
tell
me
that
we
have
to
sit
down
under
this
do
you
say
that
no
one
can
ever
get
level
with
this
king
devil
no
i
don
t
say
that
said
holmes
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
far
into
the
future
i
don
t
say
that
he
can
t
be
beat
but
you
must
give
me
time
you
must
give
me
time
we
all
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
while
those
fateful
eyes
still
strained
to
pierce
the
veil
