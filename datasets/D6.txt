chapter
i
start
in
life
i
was
born
in
the
year
in
the
city
of
york
of
a
good
family
though
not
of
that
country
my
father
being
a
foreigner
of
bremen
who
settled
first
at
hull
he
got
a
good
estate
by
merchandise
and
leaving
off
his
trade
lived
afterwards
at
york
from
whence
he
had
married
my
mother
whose
relations
were
named
robinson
a
very
good
family
in
that
country
and
from
whom
i
was
called
robinson
kreutznaer
but
by
the
usual
corruption
of
words
in
england
we
are
now
called
nay
we
call
ourselves
and
write
our
name
crusoe
and
so
my
companions
always
called
me
i
had
two
elder
brothers
one
of
whom
was
lieutenant
colonel
to
an
english
regiment
of
foot
in
flanders
formerly
commanded
by
the
famous
colonel
lockhart
and
was
killed
at
the
battle
near
dunkirk
against
the
spaniards
what
became
of
my
second
brother
i
never
knew
any
more
than
my
father
or
mother
knew
what
became
of
me
being
the
third
son
of
the
family
and
not
bred
to
any
trade
my
head
began
to
be
filled
very
early
with
rambling
thoughts
my
father
who
was
very
ancient
had
given
me
a
competent
share
of
learning
as
far
as
house
education
and
a
country
free
school
generally
go
and
designed
me
for
the
law
but
i
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
going
to
sea
and
my
inclination
to
this
led
me
so
strongly
against
the
will
nay
the
commands
of
my
father
and
against
all
the
entreaties
and
persuasions
of
my
mother
and
other
friends
that
there
seemed
to
be
something
fatal
in
that
propensity
of
nature
tending
directly
to
the
life
of
misery
which
was
to
befall
me
my
father
a
wise
and
grave
man
gave
me
serious
and
excellent
counsel
against
what
he
foresaw
was
my
design
he
called
me
one
morning
into
his
chamber
where
he
was
confined
by
the
gout
and
expostulated
very
warmly
with
me
upon
this
subject
he
asked
me
what
reasons
more
than
a
mere
wandering
inclination
i
had
for
leaving
father
s
house
and
my
native
country
where
i
might
be
well
introduced
and
had
a
prospect
of
raising
my
fortune
by
application
and
industry
with
a
life
of
ease
and
pleasure
he
told
me
it
was
men
of
desperate
fortunes
on
one
hand
or
of
aspiring
superior
fortunes
on
the
other
who
went
abroad
upon
adventures
to
rise
by
enterprise
and
make
themselves
famous
in
undertakings
of
a
nature
out
of
the
common
road
that
these
things
were
all
either
too
far
above
me
or
too
far
below
me
that
mine
was
the
middle
state
or
what
might
be
called
the
upper
station
of
low
life
which
he
had
found
by
long
experience
was
the
best
state
in
the
world
the
most
suited
to
human
happiness
not
exposed
to
the
miseries
and
hardships
the
labour
and
sufferings
of
the
mechanic
part
of
mankind
and
not
embarrassed
with
the
pride
luxury
ambition
and
envy
of
the
upper
part
of
mankind
he
told
me
i
might
judge
of
the
happiness
of
this
state
by
this
one
thing
viz
that
this
was
the
state
of
life
which
all
other
people
envied
that
kings
have
frequently
lamented
the
miserable
consequence
of
being
born
to
great
things
and
wished
they
had
been
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
two
extremes
between
the
mean
and
the
great
that
the
wise
man
gave
his
testimony
to
this
as
the
standard
of
felicity
when
he
prayed
to
have
neither
poverty
nor
riches
he
bade
me
observe
it
and
i
should
always
find
that
the
calamities
of
life
were
shared
among
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
mankind
but
that
the
middle
station
had
the
fewest
disasters
and
was
not
exposed
to
so
many
vicissitudes
as
the
higher
or
lower
part
of
mankind
nay
they
were
not
subjected
to
so
many
distempers
and
uneasinesses
either
of
body
or
mind
as
those
were
who
by
vicious
living
luxury
and
extravagances
on
the
one
hand
or
by
hard
labour
want
of
necessaries
and
mean
or
insufficient
diet
on
the
other
hand
bring
distemper
upon
themselves
by
the
natural
consequences
of
their
way
of
living
that
the
middle
station
of
life
was
calculated
for
all
kind
of
virtue
and
all
kind
of
enjoyments
that
peace
and
plenty
were
the
handmaids
of
a
middle
fortune
that
temperance
moderation
quietness
health
society
all
agreeable
diversions
and
all
desirable
pleasures
were
the
blessings
attending
the
middle
station
of
life
that
this
way
men
went
silently
and
smoothly
through
the
world
and
comfortably
out
of
it
not
embarrassed
with
the
labours
of
the
hands
or
of
the
head
not
sold
to
a
life
of
slavery
for
daily
bread
nor
harassed
with
perplexed
circumstances
which
rob
the
soul
of
peace
and
the
body
of
rest
nor
enraged
with
the
passion
of
envy
or
the
secret
burning
lust
of
ambition
for
great
things
but
in
easy
circumstances
sliding
gently
through
the
world
and
sensibly
tasting
the
sweets
of
living
without
the
bitter
feeling
that
they
are
happy
and
learning
by
every
day
s
experience
to
know
it
more
sensibly
after
this
he
pressed
me
earnestly
and
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
not
to
play
the
young
man
nor
to
precipitate
myself
into
miseries
which
nature
and
the
station
of
life
i
was
born
in
seemed
to
have
provided
against
that
i
was
under
no
necessity
of
seeking
my
bread
that
he
would
do
well
for
me
and
endeavour
to
enter
me
fairly
into
the
station
of
life
which
he
had
just
been
recommending
to
me
and
that
if
i
was
not
very
easy
and
happy
in
the
world
it
must
be
my
mere
fate
or
fault
that
must
hinder
it
and
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
answer
for
having
thus
discharged
his
duty
in
warning
me
against
measures
which
he
knew
would
be
to
my
hurt
in
a
word
that
as
he
would
do
very
kind
things
for
me
if
i
would
stay
and
settle
at
home
as
he
directed
so
he
would
not
have
so
much
hand
in
my
misfortunes
as
to
give
me
any
encouragement
to
go
away
and
to
close
all
he
told
me
i
had
my
elder
brother
for
an
example
to
whom
he
had
used
the
same
earnest
persuasions
to
keep
him
from
going
into
the
low
country
wars
but
could
not
prevail
his
young
desires
prompting
him
to
run
into
the
army
where
he
was
killed
and
though
he
said
he
would
not
cease
to
pray
for
me
yet
he
would
venture
to
say
to
me
that
if
i
did
take
this
foolish
step
god
would
not
bless
me
and
i
should
have
leisure
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
there
might
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
i
observed
in
this
last
part
of
his
discourse
which
was
truly
prophetic
though
i
suppose
my
father
did
not
know
it
to
be
so
himself
i
say
i
observed
the
tears
run
down
his
face
very
plentifully
especially
when
he
spoke
of
my
brother
who
was
killed
and
that
when
he
spoke
of
my
having
leisure
to
repent
and
none
to
assist
me
he
was
so
moved
that
he
broke
off
the
discourse
and
told
me
his
heart
was
so
full
he
could
say
no
more
to
me
i
was
sincerely
affected
with
this
discourse
and
indeed
who
could
be
otherwise
and
i
resolved
not
to
think
of
going
abroad
any
more
but
to
settle
at
home
according
to
my
father
s
desire
but
alas
a
few
days
wore
it
all
off
and
in
short
to
prevent
any
of
my
father
s
further
importunities
in
a
few
weeks
after
i
resolved
to
run
quite
away
from
him
however
i
did
not
act
quite
so
hastily
as
the
first
heat
of
my
resolution
prompted
but
i
took
my
mother
at
a
time
when
i
thought
her
a
little
more
pleasant
than
ordinary
and
told
her
that
my
thoughts
were
so
entirely
bent
upon
seeing
the
world
that
i
should
never
settle
to
anything
with
resolution
enough
to
go
through
with
it
and
my
father
had
better
give
me
his
consent
than
force
me
to
go
without
it
that
i
was
now
eighteen
years
old
which
was
too
late
to
go
apprentice
to
a
trade
or
clerk
to
an
attorney
that
i
was
sure
if
i
did
i
should
never
serve
out
my
time
but
i
should
certainly
run
away
from
my
master
before
my
time
was
out
and
go
to
sea
and
if
she
would
speak
to
my
father
to
let
me
go
one
voyage
abroad
if
i
came
home
again
and
did
not
like
it
i
would
go
no
more
and
i
would
promise
by
a
double
diligence
to
recover
the
time
that
i
had
lost
this
put
my
mother
into
a
great
passion
she
told
me
she
knew
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
speak
to
my
father
upon
any
such
subject
that
he
knew
too
well
what
was
my
interest
to
give
his
consent
to
anything
so
much
for
my
hurt
and
that
she
wondered
how
i
could
think
of
any
such
thing
after
the
discourse
i
had
had
with
my
father
and
such
kind
and
tender
expressions
as
she
knew
my
father
had
used
to
me
and
that
in
short
if
i
would
ruin
myself
there
was
no
help
for
me
but
i
might
depend
i
should
never
have
their
consent
to
it
that
for
her
part
she
would
not
have
so
much
hand
in
my
destruction
and
i
should
never
have
it
to
say
that
my
mother
was
willing
when
my
father
was
not
though
my
mother
refused
to
move
it
to
my
father
yet
i
heard
afterwards
that
she
reported
all
the
discourse
to
him
and
that
my
father
after
showing
a
great
concern
at
it
said
to
her
with
a
sigh
that
boy
might
be
happy
if
he
would
stay
at
home
but
if
he
goes
abroad
he
will
be
the
most
miserable
wretch
that
ever
was
born
i
can
give
no
consent
to
it
it
was
not
till
almost
a
year
after
this
that
i
broke
loose
though
in
the
meantime
i
continued
obstinately
deaf
to
all
proposals
of
settling
to
business
and
frequently
expostulated
with
my
father
and
mother
about
their
being
so
positively
determined
against
what
they
knew
my
inclinations
prompted
me
to
but
being
one
day
at
hull
where
i
went
casually
and
without
any
purpose
of
making
an
elopement
at
that
time
but
i
say
being
there
and
one
of
my
companions
being
about
to
sail
to
london
in
his
father
s
ship
and
prompting
me
to
go
with
them
with
the
common
allurement
of
seafaring
men
that
it
should
cost
me
nothing
for
my
passage
i
consulted
neither
father
nor
mother
any
more
nor
so
much
as
sent
them
word
of
it
but
leaving
them
to
hear
of
it
as
they
might
without
asking
god
s
blessing
or
my
father
s
without
any
consideration
of
circumstances
or
consequences
and
in
an
ill
hour
god
knows
on
the
st
of
september
i
went
on
board
a
ship
bound
for
london
never
any
young
adventurer
s
misfortunes
i
believe
began
sooner
or
continued
longer
than
mine
the
ship
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
humber
than
the
wind
began
to
blow
and
the
sea
to
rise
in
a
most
frightful
manner
and
as
i
had
never
been
at
sea
before
i
was
most
inexpressibly
sick
in
body
and
terrified
in
mind
i
began
now
seriously
to
reflect
upon
what
i
had
done
and
how
justly
i
was
overtaken
by
the
judgment
of
heaven
for
my
wicked
leaving
my
father
s
house
and
abandoning
my
duty
all
the
good
counsels
of
my
parents
my
father
s
tears
and
my
mother
s
entreaties
came
now
fresh
into
my
mind
and
my
conscience
which
was
not
yet
come
to
the
pitch
of
hardness
to
which
it
has
since
reproached
me
with
the
contempt
of
advice
and
the
breach
of
my
duty
to
god
and
my
father
all
this
while
the
storm
increased
and
the
sea
went
very
high
though
nothing
like
what
i
have
seen
many
times
since
no
nor
what
i
saw
a
few
days
after
but
it
was
enough
to
affect
me
then
who
was
but
a
young
sailor
and
had
never
known
anything
of
the
matter
i
expected
every
wave
would
have
swallowed
us
up
and
that
every
time
the
ship
fell
down
as
i
thought
it
did
in
the
trough
or
hollow
of
the
sea
we
should
never
rise
more
in
this
agony
of
mind
i
made
many
vows
and
resolutions
that
if
it
would
please
god
to
spare
my
life
in
this
one
voyage
if
ever
i
got
once
my
foot
upon
dry
land
again
i
would
go
directly
home
to
my
father
and
never
set
it
into
a
ship
again
while
i
lived
that
i
would
take
his
advice
and
never
run
myself
into
such
miseries
as
these
any
more
now
i
saw
plainly
the
goodness
of
his
observations
about
the
middle
station
of
life
how
easy
how
comfortably
he
had
lived
all
his
days
and
never
had
been
exposed
to
tempests
at
sea
or
troubles
on
shore
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
like
a
true
repenting
prodigal
go
home
to
my
father
these
wise
and
sober
thoughts
continued
all
the
while
the
storm
lasted
and
indeed
some
time
after
but
the
next
day
the
wind
was
abated
and
the
sea
calmer
and
i
began
to
be
a
little
inured
to
it
however
i
was
very
grave
for
all
that
day
being
also
a
little
sea
sick
still
but
towards
night
the
weather
cleared
up
the
wind
was
quite
over
and
a
charming
fine
evening
followed
the
sun
went
down
perfectly
clear
and
rose
so
the
next
morning
and
having
little
or
no
wind
and
a
smooth
sea
the
sun
shining
upon
it
the
sight
was
as
i
thought
the
most
delightful
that
ever
i
saw
i
had
slept
well
in
the
night
and
was
now
no
more
sea
sick
but
very
cheerful
looking
with
wonder
upon
the
sea
that
was
so
rough
and
terrible
the
day
before
and
could
be
so
calm
and
so
pleasant
in
so
little
a
time
after
and
now
lest
my
good
resolutions
should
continue
my
companion
who
had
enticed
me
away
comes
to
me
well
bob
says
he
clapping
me
upon
the
shoulder
how
do
you
do
after
it
i
warrant
you
were
frighted
wer
n
t
you
last
night
when
it
blew
but
a
capful
of
wind
a
capful
d
you
call
it
said
i
twas
a
terrible
storm
a
storm
you
fool
you
replies
he
do
you
call
that
a
storm
why
it
was
nothing
at
all
give
us
but
a
good
ship
and
sea
room
and
we
think
nothing
of
such
a
squall
of
wind
as
that
but
you
re
but
a
fresh
water
sailor
bob
come
let
us
make
a
bowl
of
punch
and
we
ll
forget
all
that
d
ye
see
what
charming
weather
tis
now
to
make
short
this
sad
part
of
my
story
we
went
the
way
of
all
sailors
the
punch
was
made
and
i
was
made
half
drunk
with
it
and
in
that
one
night
s
wickedness
i
drowned
all
my
repentance
all
my
reflections
upon
my
past
conduct
all
my
resolutions
for
the
future
in
a
word
as
the
sea
was
returned
to
its
smoothness
of
surface
and
settled
calmness
by
the
abatement
of
that
storm
so
the
hurry
of
my
thoughts
being
over
my
fears
and
apprehensions
of
being
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
being
forgotten
and
the
current
of
my
former
desires
returned
i
entirely
forgot
the
vows
and
promises
that
i
made
in
my
distress
i
found
indeed
some
intervals
of
reflection
and
the
serious
thoughts
did
as
it
were
endeavour
to
return
again
sometimes
but
i
shook
them
off
and
roused
myself
from
them
as
it
were
from
a
distemper
and
applying
myself
to
drinking
and
company
soon
mastered
the
return
of
those
fits
for
so
i
called
them
and
i
had
in
five
or
six
days
got
as
complete
a
victory
over
conscience
as
any
young
fellow
that
resolved
not
to
be
troubled
with
it
could
desire
but
i
was
to
have
another
trial
for
it
still
and
providence
as
in
such
cases
generally
it
does
resolved
to
leave
me
entirely
without
excuse
for
if
i
would
not
take
this
for
a
deliverance
the
next
was
to
be
such
a
one
as
the
worst
and
most
hardened
wretch
among
us
would
confess
both
the
danger
and
the
mercy
of
the
sixth
day
of
our
being
at
sea
we
came
into
yarmouth
roads
the
wind
having
been
contrary
and
the
weather
calm
we
had
made
but
little
way
since
the
storm
here
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
an
anchor
and
here
we
lay
the
wind
continuing
contrary
viz
at
south
west
for
seven
or
eight
days
during
which
time
a
great
many
ships
from
newcastle
came
into
the
same
roads
as
the
common
harbour
where
the
ships
might
wait
for
a
wind
for
the
river
we
had
not
however
rid
here
so
long
but
we
should
have
tided
it
up
the
river
but
that
the
wind
blew
too
fresh
and
after
we
had
lain
four
or
five
days
blew
very
hard
however
the
roads
being
reckoned
as
good
as
a
harbour
the
anchorage
good
and
our
ground
tackle
very
strong
our
men
were
unconcerned
and
not
in
the
least
apprehensive
of
danger
but
spent
the
time
in
rest
and
mirth
after
the
manner
of
the
sea
but
the
eighth
day
in
the
morning
the
wind
increased
and
we
had
all
hands
at
work
to
strike
our
topmasts
and
make
everything
snug
and
close
that
the
ship
might
ride
as
easy
as
possible
by
noon
the
sea
went
very
high
indeed
and
our
ship
rode
forecastle
in
shipped
several
seas
and
we
thought
once
or
twice
our
anchor
had
come
home
upon
which
our
master
ordered
out
the
sheet
anchor
so
that
we
rode
with
two
anchors
ahead
and
the
cables
veered
out
to
the
bitter
end
by
this
time
it
blew
a
terrible
storm
indeed
and
now
i
began
to
see
terror
and
amazement
in
the
faces
even
of
the
seamen
themselves
the
master
though
vigilant
in
the
business
of
preserving
the
ship
yet
as
he
went
in
and
out
of
his
cabin
by
me
i
could
hear
him
softly
to
himself
say
several
times
lord
be
merciful
to
us
we
shall
be
all
lost
we
shall
be
all
undone
and
the
like
during
these
first
hurries
i
was
stupid
lying
still
in
my
cabin
which
was
in
the
steerage
and
cannot
describe
my
temper
i
could
ill
resume
the
first
penitence
which
i
had
so
apparently
trampled
upon
and
hardened
myself
against
i
thought
the
bitterness
of
death
had
been
past
and
that
this
would
be
nothing
like
the
first
but
when
the
master
himself
came
by
me
as
i
said
just
now
and
said
we
should
be
all
lost
i
was
dreadfully
frighted
i
got
up
out
of
my
cabin
and
looked
out
but
such
a
dismal
sight
i
never
saw
the
sea
ran
mountains
high
and
broke
upon
us
every
three
or
four
minutes
when
i
could
look
about
i
could
see
nothing
but
distress
round
us
two
ships
that
rode
near
us
we
found
had
cut
their
masts
by
the
board
being
deep
laden
and
our
men
cried
out
that
a
ship
which
rode
about
a
mile
ahead
of
us
was
foundered
two
more
ships
being
driven
from
their
anchors
were
run
out
of
the
roads
to
sea
at
all
adventures
and
that
with
not
a
mast
standing
the
light
ships
fared
the
best
as
not
so
much
labouring
in
the
sea
but
two
or
three
of
them
drove
and
came
close
by
us
running
away
with
only
their
spritsail
out
before
the
wind
towards
evening
the
mate
and
boatswain
begged
the
master
of
our
ship
to
let
them
cut
away
the
fore
mast
which
he
was
very
unwilling
to
do
but
the
boatswain
protesting
to
him
that
if
he
did
not
the
ship
would
founder
he
consented
and
when
they
had
cut
away
the
fore
mast
the
main
mast
stood
so
loose
and
shook
the
ship
so
much
they
were
obliged
to
cut
that
away
also
and
make
a
clear
deck
any
one
may
judge
what
a
condition
i
must
be
in
at
all
this
who
was
but
a
young
sailor
and
who
had
been
in
such
a
fright
before
at
but
a
little
but
if
i
can
express
at
this
distance
the
thoughts
i
had
about
me
at
that
time
i
was
in
tenfold
more
horror
of
mind
upon
account
of
my
former
convictions
and
the
having
returned
from
them
to
the
resolutions
i
had
wickedly
taken
at
first
than
i
was
at
death
itself
and
these
added
to
the
terror
of
the
storm
put
me
into
such
a
condition
that
i
can
by
no
words
describe
it
but
the
worst
was
not
come
yet
the
storm
continued
with
such
fury
that
the
seamen
themselves
acknowledged
they
had
never
seen
a
worse
we
had
a
good
ship
but
she
was
deep
laden
and
wallowed
in
the
sea
so
that
the
seamen
every
now
and
then
cried
out
she
would
founder
it
was
my
advantage
in
one
respect
that
i
did
not
know
what
they
meant
by
founder
till
i
inquired
however
the
storm
was
so
violent
that
i
saw
what
is
not
often
seen
the
master
the
boatswain
and
some
others
more
sensible
than
the
rest
at
their
prayers
and
expecting
every
moment
when
the
ship
would
go
to
the
bottom
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
under
all
the
rest
of
our
distresses
one
of
the
men
that
had
been
down
to
see
cried
out
we
had
sprung
a
leak
another
said
there
was
four
feet
water
in
the
hold
then
all
hands
were
called
to
the
pump
at
that
word
my
heart
as
i
thought
died
within
me
and
i
fell
backwards
upon
the
side
of
my
bed
where
i
sat
into
the
cabin
however
the
men
roused
me
and
told
me
that
i
that
was
able
to
do
nothing
before
was
as
well
able
to
pump
as
another
at
which
i
stirred
up
and
went
to
the
pump
and
worked
very
heartily
while
this
was
doing
the
master
seeing
some
light
colliers
who
not
able
to
ride
out
the
storm
were
obliged
to
slip
and
run
away
to
sea
and
would
come
near
us
ordered
to
fire
a
gun
as
a
signal
of
distress
i
who
knew
nothing
what
they
meant
thought
the
ship
had
broken
or
some
dreadful
thing
happened
in
a
word
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
fell
down
in
a
swoon
as
this
was
a
time
when
everybody
had
his
own
life
to
think
of
nobody
minded
me
or
what
was
become
of
me
but
another
man
stepped
up
to
the
pump
and
thrusting
me
aside
with
his
foot
let
me
lie
thinking
i
had
been
dead
and
it
was
a
great
while
before
i
came
to
myself
we
worked
on
but
the
water
increasing
in
the
hold
it
was
apparent
that
the
ship
would
founder
and
though
the
storm
began
to
abate
a
little
yet
it
was
not
possible
she
could
swim
till
we
might
run
into
any
port
so
the
master
continued
firing
guns
for
help
and
a
light
ship
who
had
rid
it
out
just
ahead
of
us
ventured
a
boat
out
to
help
us
it
was
with
the
utmost
hazard
the
boat
came
near
us
but
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
get
on
board
or
for
the
boat
to
lie
near
the
ship
s
side
till
at
last
the
men
rowing
very
heartily
and
venturing
their
lives
to
save
ours
our
men
cast
them
a
rope
over
the
stern
with
a
buoy
to
it
and
then
veered
it
out
a
great
length
which
they
after
much
labour
and
hazard
took
hold
of
and
we
hauled
them
close
under
our
stern
and
got
all
into
their
boat
it
was
to
no
purpose
for
them
or
us
after
we
were
in
the
boat
to
think
of
reaching
their
own
ship
so
all
agreed
to
let
her
drive
and
only
to
pull
her
in
towards
shore
as
much
as
we
could
and
our
master
promised
them
that
if
the
boat
was
staved
upon
shore
he
would
make
it
good
to
their
master
so
partly
rowing
and
partly
driving
our
boat
went
away
to
the
northward
sloping
towards
the
shore
almost
as
far
as
winterton
ness
we
were
not
much
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
out
of
our
ship
till
we
saw
her
sink
and
then
i
understood
for
the
first
time
what
was
meant
by
a
ship
foundering
in
the
sea
i
must
acknowledge
i
had
hardly
eyes
to
look
up
when
the
seamen
told
me
she
was
sinking
for
from
the
moment
that
they
rather
put
me
into
the
boat
than
that
i
might
be
said
to
go
in
my
heart
was
as
it
were
dead
within
me
partly
with
fright
partly
with
horror
of
mind
and
the
thoughts
of
what
was
yet
before
me
while
we
were
in
this
condition
the
men
yet
labouring
at
the
oar
to
bring
the
boat
near
the
shore
we
could
see
when
our
boat
mounting
the
waves
we
were
able
to
see
the
shore
a
great
many
people
running
along
the
strand
to
assist
us
when
we
should
come
near
but
we
made
but
slow
way
towards
the
shore
nor
were
we
able
to
reach
the
shore
till
being
past
the
lighthouse
at
winterton
the
shore
falls
off
to
the
westward
towards
cromer
and
so
the
land
broke
off
a
little
the
violence
of
the
wind
here
we
got
in
and
though
not
without
much
difficulty
got
all
safe
on
shore
and
walked
afterwards
on
foot
to
yarmouth
where
as
unfortunate
men
we
were
used
with
great
humanity
as
well
by
the
magistrates
of
the
town
who
assigned
us
good
quarters
as
by
particular
merchants
and
owners
of
ships
and
had
money
given
us
sufficient
to
carry
us
either
to
london
or
back
to
hull
as
we
thought
fit
had
i
now
had
the
sense
to
have
gone
back
to
hull
and
have
gone
home
i
had
been
happy
and
my
father
as
in
our
blessed
saviour
s
parable
had
even
killed
the
fatted
calf
for
me
for
hearing
the
ship
i
went
away
in
was
cast
away
in
yarmouth
roads
it
was
a
great
while
before
he
had
any
assurances
that
i
was
not
drowned
but
my
ill
fate
pushed
me
on
now
with
an
obstinacy
that
nothing
could
resist
and
though
i
had
several
times
loud
calls
from
my
reason
and
my
more
composed
judgment
to
go
home
yet
i
had
no
power
to
do
it
i
know
not
what
to
call
this
nor
will
i
urge
that
it
is
a
secret
overruling
decree
that
hurries
us
on
to
be
the
instruments
of
our
own
destruction
even
though
it
be
before
us
and
that
we
rush
upon
it
with
our
eyes
open
certainly
nothing
but
some
such
decreed
unavoidable
misery
which
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
escape
could
have
pushed
me
forward
against
the
calm
reasonings
and
persuasions
of
my
most
retired
thoughts
and
against
two
such
visible
instructions
as
i
had
met
with
in
my
first
attempt
my
comrade
who
had
helped
to
harden
me
before
and
who
was
the
master
s
son
was
now
less
forward
than
i
the
first
time
he
spoke
to
me
after
we
were
at
yarmouth
which
was
not
till
two
or
three
days
for
we
were
separated
in
the
town
to
several
quarters
i
say
the
first
time
he
saw
me
it
appeared
his
tone
was
altered
and
looking
very
melancholy
and
shaking
his
head
he
asked
me
how
i
did
and
telling
his
father
who
i
was
and
how
i
had
come
this
voyage
only
for
a
trial
in
order
to
go
further
abroad
his
father
turning
to
me
with
a
very
grave
and
concerned
tone
young
man
says
he
you
ought
never
to
go
to
sea
any
more
you
ought
to
take
this
for
a
plain
and
visible
token
that
you
are
not
to
be
a
seafaring
man
why
sir
said
i
will
you
go
to
sea
no
more
that
is
another
case
said
he
it
is
my
calling
and
therefore
my
duty
but
as
you
made
this
voyage
on
trial
you
see
what
a
taste
heaven
has
given
you
of
what
you
are
to
expect
if
you
persist
perhaps
this
has
all
befallen
us
on
your
account
like
jonah
in
the
ship
of
tarshish
pray
continues
he
what
are
you
and
on
what
account
did
you
go
to
sea
upon
that
i
told
him
some
of
my
story
at
the
end
of
which
he
burst
out
into
a
strange
kind
of
passion
what
had
i
done
says
he
that
such
an
unhappy
wretch
should
come
into
my
ship
i
would
not
set
my
foot
in
the
same
ship
with
thee
again
for
a
thousand
pounds
this
indeed
was
as
i
said
an
excursion
of
his
spirits
which
were
yet
agitated
by
the
sense
of
his
loss
and
was
farther
than
he
could
have
authority
to
go
however
he
afterwards
talked
very
gravely
to
me
exhorting
me
to
go
back
to
my
father
and
not
tempt
providence
to
my
ruin
telling
me
i
might
see
a
visible
hand
of
heaven
against
me
and
young
man
said
he
depend
upon
it
if
you
do
not
go
back
wherever
you
go
you
will
meet
with
nothing
but
disasters
and
disappointments
till
your
father
s
words
are
fulfilled
upon
you
we
parted
soon
after
for
i
made
him
little
answer
and
i
saw
him
no
more
which
way
he
went
i
knew
not
as
for
me
having
some
money
in
my
pocket
i
travelled
to
london
by
land
and
there
as
well
as
on
the
road
had
many
struggles
with
myself
what
course
of
life
i
should
take
and
whether
i
should
go
home
or
to
sea
as
to
going
home
shame
opposed
the
best
motions
that
offered
to
my
thoughts
and
it
immediately
occurred
to
me
how
i
should
be
laughed
at
among
the
neighbours
and
should
be
ashamed
to
see
not
my
father
and
mother
only
but
even
everybody
else
from
whence
i
have
since
often
observed
how
incongruous
and
irrational
the
common
temper
of
mankind
is
especially
of
youth
to
that
reason
which
ought
to
guide
them
in
such
cases
viz
that
they
are
not
ashamed
to
sin
and
yet
are
ashamed
to
repent
not
ashamed
of
the
action
for
which
they
ought
justly
to
be
esteemed
fools
but
are
ashamed
of
the
returning
which
only
can
make
them
be
esteemed
wise
men
in
this
state
of
life
however
i
remained
some
time
uncertain
what
measures
to
take
and
what
course
of
life
to
lead
an
irresistible
reluctance
continued
to
going
home
and
as
i
stayed
away
a
while
the
remembrance
of
the
distress
i
had
been
in
wore
off
and
as
that
abated
the
little
motion
i
had
in
my
desires
to
return
wore
off
with
it
till
at
last
i
quite
laid
aside
the
thoughts
of
it
and
looked
out
for
a
voyage
chapter
ii
slavery
and
escape
that
evil
influence
which
carried
me
first
away
from
my
father
s
house
which
hurried
me
into
the
wild
and
indigested
notion
of
raising
my
fortune
and
that
impressed
those
conceits
so
forcibly
upon
me
as
to
make
me
deaf
to
all
good
advice
and
to
the
entreaties
and
even
the
commands
of
my
father
i
say
the
same
influence
whatever
it
was
presented
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
enterprises
to
my
view
and
i
went
on
board
a
vessel
bound
to
the
coast
of
africa
or
as
our
sailors
vulgarly
called
it
a
voyage
to
guinea
it
was
my
great
misfortune
that
in
all
these
adventures
i
did
not
ship
myself
as
a
sailor
when
though
i
might
indeed
have
worked
a
little
harder
than
ordinary
yet
at
the
same
time
i
should
have
learnt
the
duty
and
office
of
a
fore
mast
man
and
in
time
might
have
qualified
myself
for
a
mate
or
lieutenant
if
not
for
a
master
but
as
it
was
always
my
fate
to
choose
for
the
worse
so
i
did
here
for
having
money
in
my
pocket
and
good
clothes
upon
my
back
i
would
always
go
on
board
in
the
habit
of
a
gentleman
and
so
i
neither
had
any
business
in
the
ship
nor
learned
to
do
any
it
was
my
lot
first
of
all
to
fall
into
pretty
good
company
in
london
which
does
not
always
happen
to
such
loose
and
misguided
young
fellows
as
i
then
was
the
devil
generally
not
omitting
to
lay
some
snare
for
them
very
early
but
it
was
not
so
with
me
i
first
got
acquainted
with
the
master
of
a
ship
who
had
been
on
the
coast
of
guinea
and
who
having
had
very
good
success
there
was
resolved
to
go
again
this
captain
taking
a
fancy
to
my
conversation
which
was
not
at
all
disagreeable
at
that
time
hearing
me
say
i
had
a
mind
to
see
the
world
told
me
if
i
would
go
the
voyage
with
him
i
should
be
at
no
expense
i
should
be
his
messmate
and
his
companion
and
if
i
could
carry
anything
with
me
i
should
have
all
the
advantage
of
it
that
the
trade
would
admit
and
perhaps
i
might
meet
with
some
encouragement
i
embraced
the
offer
and
entering
into
a
strict
friendship
with
this
captain
who
was
an
honest
plain
dealing
man
i
went
the
voyage
with
him
and
carried
a
small
adventure
with
me
which
by
the
disinterested
honesty
of
my
friend
the
captain
i
increased
very
considerably
for
i
carried
about
in
such
toys
and
trifles
as
the
captain
directed
me
to
buy
these
i
had
mustered
together
by
the
assistance
of
some
of
my
relations
whom
i
corresponded
with
and
who
i
believe
got
my
father
or
at
least
my
mother
to
contribute
so
much
as
that
to
my
first
adventure
this
was
the
only
voyage
which
i
may
say
was
successful
in
all
my
adventures
which
i
owe
to
the
integrity
and
honesty
of
my
friend
the
captain
under
whom
also
i
got
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
mathematics
and
the
rules
of
navigation
learned
how
to
keep
an
account
of
the
ship
s
course
take
an
observation
and
in
short
to
understand
some
things
that
were
needful
to
be
understood
by
a
sailor
for
as
he
took
delight
to
instruct
me
i
took
delight
to
learn
and
in
a
word
this
voyage
made
me
both
a
sailor
and
a
merchant
for
i
brought
home
five
pounds
nine
ounces
of
gold
dust
for
my
adventure
which
yielded
me
in
london
at
my
return
almost
and
this
filled
me
with
those
aspiring
thoughts
which
have
since
so
completed
my
ruin
yet
even
in
this
voyage
i
had
my
misfortunes
too
particularly
that
i
was
continually
sick
being
thrown
into
a
violent
calenture
by
the
excessive
heat
of
the
climate
our
principal
trading
being
upon
the
coast
from
latitude
of
degrees
north
even
to
the
line
itself
i
was
now
set
up
for
a
guinea
trader
and
my
friend
to
my
great
misfortune
dying
soon
after
his
arrival
i
resolved
to
go
the
same
voyage
again
and
i
embarked
in
the
same
vessel
with
one
who
was
his
mate
in
the
former
voyage
and
had
now
got
the
command
of
the
ship
this
was
the
unhappiest
voyage
that
ever
man
made
for
though
i
did
not
carry
quite
of
my
new
gained
wealth
so
that
i
had
left
which
i
had
lodged
with
my
friend
s
widow
who
was
very
just
to
me
yet
i
fell
into
terrible
misfortunes
the
first
was
this
our
ship
making
her
course
towards
the
canary
islands
or
rather
between
those
islands
and
the
african
shore
was
surprised
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
by
a
turkish
rover
of
sallee
who
gave
chase
to
us
with
all
the
sail
she
could
make
we
crowded
also
as
much
canvas
as
our
yards
would
spread
or
our
masts
carry
to
get
clear
but
finding
the
pirate
gained
upon
us
and
would
certainly
come
up
with
us
in
a
few
hours
we
prepared
to
fight
our
ship
having
twelve
guns
and
the
rogue
eighteen
about
three
in
the
afternoon
he
came
up
with
us
and
bringing
to
by
mistake
just
athwart
our
quarter
instead
of
athwart
our
stern
as
he
intended
we
brought
eight
of
our
guns
to
bear
on
that
side
and
poured
in
a
broadside
upon
him
which
made
him
sheer
off
again
after
returning
our
fire
and
pouring
in
also
his
small
shot
from
near
two
hundred
men
which
he
had
on
board
however
we
had
not
a
man
touched
all
our
men
keeping
close
he
prepared
to
attack
us
again
and
we
to
defend
ourselves
but
laying
us
on
board
the
next
time
upon
our
other
quarter
he
entered
sixty
men
upon
our
decks
who
immediately
fell
to
cutting
and
hacking
the
sails
and
rigging
we
plied
them
with
small
shot
half
pikes
powder
chests
and
such
like
and
cleared
our
deck
of
them
twice
however
to
cut
short
this
melancholy
part
of
our
story
our
ship
being
disabled
and
three
of
our
men
killed
and
eight
wounded
we
were
obliged
to
yield
and
were
carried
all
prisoners
into
sallee
a
port
belonging
to
the
moors
the
usage
i
had
there
was
not
so
dreadful
as
at
first
i
apprehended
nor
was
i
carried
up
the
country
to
the
emperor
s
court
as
the
rest
of
our
men
were
but
was
kept
by
the
captain
of
the
rover
as
his
proper
prize
and
made
his
slave
being
young
and
nimble
and
fit
for
his
business
at
this
surprising
change
of
my
circumstances
from
a
merchant
to
a
miserable
slave
i
was
perfectly
overwhelmed
and
now
i
looked
back
upon
my
father
s
prophetic
discourse
to
me
that
i
should
be
miserable
and
have
none
to
relieve
me
which
i
thought
was
now
so
effectually
brought
to
pass
that
i
could
not
be
worse
for
now
the
hand
of
heaven
had
overtaken
me
and
i
was
undone
without
redemption
but
alas
this
was
but
a
taste
of
the
misery
i
was
to
go
through
as
will
appear
in
the
sequel
of
this
story
as
my
new
patron
or
master
had
taken
me
home
to
his
house
so
i
was
in
hopes
that
he
would
take
me
with
him
when
he
went
to
sea
again
believing
that
it
would
some
time
or
other
be
his
fate
to
be
taken
by
a
spanish
or
portugal
man
of
war
and
that
then
i
should
be
set
at
liberty
but
this
hope
of
mine
was
soon
taken
away
for
when
he
went
to
sea
he
left
me
on
shore
to
look
after
his
little
garden
and
do
the
common
drudgery
of
slaves
about
his
house
and
when
he
came
home
again
from
his
cruise
he
ordered
me
to
lie
in
the
cabin
to
look
after
the
ship
here
i
meditated
nothing
but
my
escape
and
what
method
i
might
take
to
effect
it
but
found
no
way
that
had
the
least
probability
in
it
nothing
presented
to
make
the
supposition
of
it
rational
for
i
had
nobody
to
communicate
it
to
that
would
embark
with
me
no
fellow
slave
no
englishman
irishman
or
scotchman
there
but
myself
so
that
for
two
years
though
i
often
pleased
myself
with
the
imagination
yet
i
never
had
the
least
encouraging
prospect
of
putting
it
in
practice
after
about
two
years
an
odd
circumstance
presented
itself
which
put
the
old
thought
of
making
some
attempt
for
my
liberty
again
in
my
head
my
patron
lying
at
home
longer
than
usual
without
fitting
out
his
ship
which
as
i
heard
was
for
want
of
money
he
used
constantly
once
or
twice
a
week
sometimes
oftener
if
the
weather
was
fair
to
take
the
ship
s
pinnace
and
go
out
into
the
road
a
fishing
and
as
he
always
took
me
and
young
maresco
with
him
to
row
the
boat
we
made
him
very
merry
and
i
proved
very
dexterous
in
catching
fish
insomuch
that
sometimes
he
would
send
me
with
a
moor
one
of
his
kinsmen
and
the
youth
the
maresco
as
they
called
him
to
catch
a
dish
of
fish
for
him
it
happened
one
time
that
going
a
fishing
in
a
calm
morning
a
fog
rose
so
thick
that
though
we
were
not
half
a
league
from
the
shore
we
lost
sight
of
it
and
rowing
we
knew
not
whither
or
which
way
we
laboured
all
day
and
all
the
next
night
and
when
the
morning
came
we
found
we
had
pulled
off
to
sea
instead
of
pulling
in
for
the
shore
and
that
we
were
at
least
two
leagues
from
the
shore
however
we
got
well
in
again
though
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
some
danger
for
the
wind
began
to
blow
pretty
fresh
in
the
morning
but
we
were
all
very
hungry
but
our
patron
warned
by
this
disaster
resolved
to
take
more
care
of
himself
for
the
future
and
having
lying
by
him
the
longboat
of
our
english
ship
that
he
had
taken
he
resolved
he
would
not
go
a
fishing
any
more
without
a
compass
and
some
provision
so
he
ordered
the
carpenter
of
his
ship
who
also
was
an
english
slave
to
build
a
little
state
room
or
cabin
in
the
middle
of
the
long
boat
like
that
of
a
barge
with
a
place
to
stand
behind
it
to
steer
and
haul
home
the
main
sheet
the
room
before
for
a
hand
or
two
to
stand
and
work
the
sails
she
sailed
with
what
we
call
a
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
and
the
boom
jibed
over
the
top
of
the
cabin
which
lay
very
snug
and
low
and
had
in
it
room
for
him
to
lie
with
a
slave
or
two
and
a
table
to
eat
on
with
some
small
lockers
to
put
in
some
bottles
of
such
liquor
as
he
thought
fit
to
drink
and
his
bread
rice
and
coffee
we
went
frequently
out
with
this
boat
a
fishing
and
as
i
was
most
dexterous
to
catch
fish
for
him
he
never
went
without
me
it
happened
that
he
had
appointed
to
go
out
in
this
boat
either
for
pleasure
or
for
fish
with
two
or
three
moors
of
some
distinction
in
that
place
and
for
whom
he
had
provided
extraordinarily
and
had
therefore
sent
on
board
the
boat
overnight
a
larger
store
of
provisions
than
ordinary
and
had
ordered
me
to
get
ready
three
fusees
with
powder
and
shot
which
were
on
board
his
ship
for
that
they
designed
some
sport
of
fowling
as
well
as
fishing
i
got
all
things
ready
as
he
had
directed
and
waited
the
next
morning
with
the
boat
washed
clean
her
ancient
and
pendants
out
and
everything
to
accommodate
his
guests
when
by
and
by
my
patron
came
on
board
alone
and
told
me
his
guests
had
put
off
going
from
some
business
that
fell
out
and
ordered
me
with
the
man
and
boy
as
usual
to
go
out
with
the
boat
and
catch
them
some
fish
for
that
his
friends
were
to
sup
at
his
house
and
commanded
that
as
soon
as
i
got
some
fish
i
should
bring
it
home
to
his
house
all
which
i
prepared
to
do
this
moment
my
former
notions
of
deliverance
darted
into
my
thoughts
for
now
i
found
i
was
likely
to
have
a
little
ship
at
my
command
and
my
master
being
gone
i
prepared
to
furnish
myself
not
for
fishing
business
but
for
a
voyage
though
i
knew
not
neither
did
i
so
much
as
consider
whither
i
should
steer
anywhere
to
get
out
of
that
place
was
my
desire
my
first
contrivance
was
to
make
a
pretence
to
speak
to
this
moor
to
get
something
for
our
subsistence
on
board
for
i
told
him
we
must
not
presume
to
eat
of
our
patron
s
bread
he
said
that
was
true
so
he
brought
a
large
basket
of
rusk
or
biscuit
and
three
jars
of
fresh
water
into
the
boat
i
knew
where
my
patron
s
case
of
bottles
stood
which
it
was
evident
by
the
make
were
taken
out
of
some
english
prize
and
i
conveyed
them
into
the
boat
while
the
moor
was
on
shore
as
if
they
had
been
there
before
for
our
master
i
conveyed
also
a
great
lump
of
beeswax
into
the
boat
which
weighed
about
half
a
hundred
weight
with
a
parcel
of
twine
or
thread
a
hatchet
a
saw
and
a
hammer
all
of
which
were
of
great
use
to
us
afterwards
especially
the
wax
to
make
candles
another
trick
i
tried
upon
him
which
he
innocently
came
into
also
his
name
was
ismael
which
they
call
muley
or
moely
so
i
called
to
him
moely
said
i
our
patron
s
guns
are
on
board
the
boat
can
you
not
get
a
little
powder
and
shot
it
may
be
we
may
kill
some
alcamies
a
fowl
like
our
curlews
for
ourselves
for
i
know
he
keeps
the
gunner
s
stores
in
the
ship
yes
says
he
i
ll
bring
some
and
accordingly
he
brought
a
great
leather
pouch
which
held
a
pound
and
a
half
of
powder
or
rather
more
and
another
with
shot
that
had
five
or
six
pounds
with
some
bullets
and
put
all
into
the
boat
at
the
same
time
i
had
found
some
powder
of
my
master
s
in
the
great
cabin
with
which
i
filled
one
of
the
large
bottles
in
the
case
which
was
almost
empty
pouring
what
was
in
it
into
another
and
thus
furnished
with
everything
needful
we
sailed
out
of
the
port
to
fish
the
castle
which
is
at
the
entrance
of
the
port
knew
who
we
were
and
took
no
notice
of
us
and
we
were
not
above
a
mile
out
of
the
port
before
we
hauled
in
our
sail
and
set
us
down
to
fish
the
wind
blew
from
the
n
n
e
which
was
contrary
to
my
desire
for
had
it
blown
southerly
i
had
been
sure
to
have
made
the
coast
of
spain
and
at
least
reached
to
the
bay
of
cadiz
but
my
resolutions
were
blow
which
way
it
would
i
would
be
gone
from
that
horrid
place
where
i
was
and
leave
the
rest
to
fate
after
we
had
fished
some
time
and
caught
nothing
for
when
i
had
fish
on
my
hook
i
would
not
pull
them
up
that
he
might
not
see
them
i
said
to
the
moor
this
will
not
do
our
master
will
not
be
thus
served
we
must
stand
farther
off
he
thinking
no
harm
agreed
and
being
in
the
head
of
the
boat
set
the
sails
and
as
i
had
the
helm
i
ran
the
boat
out
near
a
league
farther
and
then
brought
her
to
as
if
i
would
fish
when
giving
the
boy
the
helm
i
stepped
forward
to
where
the
moor
was
and
making
as
if
i
stooped
for
something
behind
him
i
took
him
by
surprise
with
my
arm
under
his
waist
and
tossed
him
clear
overboard
into
the
sea
he
rose
immediately
for
he
swam
like
a
cork
and
called
to
me
begged
to
be
taken
in
told
me
he
would
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
he
swam
so
strong
after
the
boat
that
he
would
have
reached
me
very
quickly
there
being
but
little
wind
upon
which
i
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
fetching
one
of
the
fowling
pieces
i
presented
it
at
him
and
told
him
i
had
done
him
no
hurt
and
if
he
would
be
quiet
i
would
do
him
none
but
said
i
you
swim
well
enough
to
reach
to
the
shore
and
the
sea
is
calm
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
shore
and
i
will
do
you
no
harm
but
if
you
come
near
the
boat
i
ll
shoot
you
through
the
head
for
i
am
resolved
to
have
my
liberty
so
he
turned
himself
about
and
swam
for
the
shore
and
i
make
no
doubt
but
he
reached
it
with
ease
for
he
was
an
excellent
swimmer
i
could
have
been
content
to
have
taken
this
moor
with
me
and
have
drowned
the
boy
but
there
was
no
venturing
to
trust
him
when
he
was
gone
i
turned
to
the
boy
whom
they
called
xury
and
said
to
him
xury
if
you
will
be
faithful
to
me
i
ll
make
you
a
great
man
but
if
you
will
not
stroke
your
face
to
be
true
to
me
that
is
swear
by
mahomet
and
his
father
s
beard
i
must
throw
you
into
the
sea
too
the
boy
smiled
in
my
face
and
spoke
so
innocently
that
i
could
not
distrust
him
and
swore
to
be
faithful
to
me
and
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
while
i
was
in
view
of
the
moor
that
was
swimming
i
stood
out
directly
to
sea
with
the
boat
rather
stretching
to
windward
that
they
might
think
me
gone
towards
the
straits
mouth
as
indeed
any
one
that
had
been
in
their
wits
must
have
been
supposed
to
do
for
who
would
have
supposed
we
were
sailed
on
to
the
southward
to
the
truly
barbarian
coast
where
whole
nations
of
negroes
were
sure
to
surround
us
with
their
canoes
and
destroy
us
where
we
could
not
go
on
shore
but
we
should
be
devoured
by
savage
beasts
or
more
merciless
savages
of
human
kind
but
as
soon
as
it
grew
dusk
in
the
evening
i
changed
my
course
and
steered
directly
south
and
by
east
bending
my
course
a
little
towards
the
east
that
i
might
keep
in
with
the
shore
and
having
a
fair
fresh
gale
of
wind
and
a
smooth
quiet
sea
i
made
such
sail
that
i
believe
by
the
next
day
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
i
first
made
the
land
i
could
not
be
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
south
of
sallee
quite
beyond
the
emperor
of
morocco
s
dominions
or
indeed
of
any
other
king
thereabouts
for
we
saw
no
people
yet
such
was
the
fright
i
had
taken
of
the
moors
and
the
dreadful
apprehensions
i
had
of
falling
into
their
hands
that
i
would
not
stop
or
go
on
shore
or
come
to
an
anchor
the
wind
continuing
fair
till
i
had
sailed
in
that
manner
five
days
and
then
the
wind
shifting
to
the
southward
i
concluded
also
that
if
any
of
our
vessels
were
in
chase
of
me
they
also
would
now
give
over
so
i
ventured
to
make
to
the
coast
and
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
i
knew
not
what
nor
where
neither
what
latitude
what
country
what
nation
or
what
river
i
neither
saw
nor
desired
to
see
any
people
the
principal
thing
i
wanted
was
fresh
water
we
came
into
this
creek
in
the
evening
resolving
to
swim
on
shore
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
and
discover
the
country
but
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
dark
we
heard
such
dreadful
noises
of
the
barking
roaring
and
howling
of
wild
creatures
of
we
knew
not
what
kinds
that
the
poor
boy
was
ready
to
die
with
fear
and
begged
of
me
not
to
go
on
shore
till
day
well
xury
said
i
then
i
won
t
but
it
may
be
that
we
may
see
men
by
day
who
will
be
as
bad
to
us
as
those
lions
then
we
give
them
the
shoot
gun
says
xury
laughing
make
them
run
wey
such
english
xury
spoke
by
conversing
among
us
slaves
however
i
was
glad
to
see
the
boy
so
cheerful
and
i
gave
him
a
dram
out
of
our
patron
s
case
of
bottles
to
cheer
him
up
after
all
xury
s
advice
was
good
and
i
took
it
we
dropped
our
little
anchor
and
lay
still
all
night
i
say
still
for
we
slept
none
for
in
two
or
three
hours
we
saw
vast
great
creatures
we
knew
not
what
to
call
them
of
many
sorts
come
down
to
the
sea
shore
and
run
into
the
water
wallowing
and
washing
themselves
for
the
pleasure
of
cooling
themselves
and
they
made
such
hideous
howlings
and
yellings
that
i
never
indeed
heard
the
like
xury
was
dreadfully
frighted
and
indeed
so
was
i
too
but
we
were
both
more
frighted
when
we
heard
one
of
these
mighty
creatures
come
swimming
towards
our
boat
we
could
not
see
him
but
we
might
hear
him
by
his
blowing
to
be
a
monstrous
huge
and
furious
beast
xury
said
it
was
a
lion
and
it
might
be
so
for
aught
i
know
but
poor
xury
cried
to
me
to
weigh
the
anchor
and
row
away
no
says
i
xury
we
can
slip
our
cable
with
the
buoy
to
it
and
go
off
to
sea
they
cannot
follow
us
far
i
had
no
sooner
said
so
but
i
perceived
the
creature
whatever
it
was
within
two
oars
length
which
something
surprised
me
however
i
immediately
stepped
to
the
cabin
door
and
taking
up
my
gun
fired
at
him
upon
which
he
immediately
turned
about
and
swam
towards
the
shore
again
but
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
horrid
noises
and
hideous
cries
and
howlings
that
were
raised
as
well
upon
the
edge
of
the
shore
as
higher
within
the
country
upon
the
noise
or
report
of
the
gun
a
thing
i
have
some
reason
to
believe
those
creatures
had
never
heard
before
this
convinced
me
that
there
was
no
going
on
shore
for
us
in
the
night
on
that
coast
and
how
to
venture
on
shore
in
the
day
was
another
question
too
for
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
any
of
the
savages
had
been
as
bad
as
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lions
and
tigers
at
least
we
were
equally
apprehensive
of
the
danger
of
it
be
that
as
it
would
we
were
obliged
to
go
on
shore
somewhere
or
other
for
water
for
we
had
not
a
pint
left
in
the
boat
when
and
where
to
get
to
it
was
the
point
xury
said
if
i
would
let
him
go
on
shore
with
one
of
the
jars
he
would
find
if
there
was
any
water
and
bring
some
to
me
i
asked
him
why
he
would
go
why
i
should
not
go
and
he
stay
in
the
boat
the
boy
answered
with
so
much
affection
as
made
me
love
him
ever
after
says
he
if
wild
mans
come
they
eat
me
you
go
wey
well
xury
said
i
we
will
both
go
and
if
the
wild
mans
come
we
will
kill
them
they
shall
eat
neither
of
us
so
i
gave
xury
a
piece
of
rusk
bread
to
eat
and
a
dram
out
of
our
patron
s
case
of
bottles
which
i
mentioned
before
and
we
hauled
the
boat
in
as
near
the
shore
as
we
thought
was
proper
and
so
waded
on
shore
carrying
nothing
but
our
arms
and
two
jars
for
water
i
did
not
care
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
boat
fearing
the
coming
of
canoes
with
savages
down
the
river
but
the
boy
seeing
a
low
place
about
a
mile
up
the
country
rambled
to
it
and
by
and
by
i
saw
him
come
running
towards
me
i
thought
he
was
pursued
by
some
savage
or
frighted
with
some
wild
beast
and
i
ran
forward
towards
him
to
help
him
but
when
i
came
nearer
to
him
i
saw
something
hanging
over
his
shoulders
which
was
a
creature
that
he
had
shot
like
a
hare
but
different
in
colour
and
longer
legs
however
we
were
very
glad
of
it
and
it
was
very
good
meat
but
the
great
joy
that
poor
xury
came
with
was
to
tell
me
he
had
found
good
water
and
seen
no
wild
mans
but
we
found
afterwards
that
we
need
not
take
such
pains
for
water
for
a
little
higher
up
the
creek
where
we
were
we
found
the
water
fresh
when
the
tide
was
out
which
flowed
but
a
little
way
up
so
we
filled
our
jars
and
feasted
on
the
hare
he
had
killed
and
prepared
to
go
on
our
way
having
seen
no
footsteps
of
any
human
creature
in
that
part
of
the
country
as
i
had
been
one
voyage
to
this
coast
before
i
knew
very
well
that
the
islands
of
the
canaries
and
the
cape
de
verde
islands
also
lay
not
far
off
from
the
coast
but
as
i
had
no
instruments
to
take
an
observation
to
know
what
latitude
we
were
in
and
not
exactly
knowing
or
at
least
remembering
what
latitude
they
were
in
i
knew
not
where
to
look
for
them
or
when
to
stand
off
to
sea
towards
them
otherwise
i
might
now
easily
have
found
some
of
these
islands
but
my
hope
was
that
if
i
stood
along
this
coast
till
i
came
to
that
part
where
the
english
traded
i
should
find
some
of
their
vessels
upon
their
usual
design
of
trade
that
would
relieve
and
take
us
in
by
the
best
of
my
calculation
that
place
where
i
now
was
must
be
that
country
which
lying
between
the
emperor
of
morocco
s
dominions
and
the
negroes
lies
waste
and
uninhabited
except
by
wild
beasts
the
negroes
having
abandoned
it
and
gone
farther
south
for
fear
of
the
moors
and
the
moors
not
thinking
it
worth
inhabiting
by
reason
of
its
barrenness
and
indeed
both
forsaking
it
because
of
the
prodigious
number
of
tigers
lions
leopards
and
other
furious
creatures
which
harbour
there
so
that
the
moors
use
it
for
their
hunting
only
where
they
go
like
an
army
two
or
three
thousand
men
at
a
time
and
indeed
for
near
a
hundred
miles
together
upon
this
coast
we
saw
nothing
but
a
waste
uninhabited
country
by
day
and
heard
nothing
but
howlings
and
roaring
of
wild
beasts
by
night
once
or
twice
in
the
daytime
i
thought
i
saw
the
pico
of
teneriffe
being
the
high
top
of
the
mountain
teneriffe
in
the
canaries
and
had
a
great
mind
to
venture
out
in
hopes
of
reaching
thither
but
having
tried
twice
i
was
forced
in
again
by
contrary
winds
the
sea
also
going
too
high
for
my
little
vessel
so
i
resolved
to
pursue
my
first
design
and
keep
along
the
shore
several
times
i
was
obliged
to
land
for
fresh
water
after
we
had
left
this
place
and
once
in
particular
being
early
in
morning
we
came
to
an
anchor
under
a
little
point
of
land
which
was
pretty
high
and
the
tide
beginning
to
flow
we
lay
still
to
go
farther
in
xury
whose
eyes
were
more
about
him
than
it
seems
mine
were
calls
softly
to
me
and
tells
me
that
we
had
best
go
farther
off
the
shore
for
says
he
look
yonder
lies
a
dreadful
monster
on
the
side
of
that
hillock
fast
asleep
i
looked
where
he
pointed
and
saw
a
dreadful
monster
indeed
for
it
was
a
terrible
great
lion
that
lay
on
the
side
of
the
shore
under
the
shade
of
a
piece
of
the
hill
that
hung
as
it
were
a
little
over
him
xury
says
i
you
shall
on
shore
and
kill
him
xury
looked
frighted
and
said
me
kill
he
eat
me
at
one
mouth
one
mouthful
he
meant
however
i
said
no
more
to
the
boy
but
bade
him
lie
still
and
i
took
our
biggest
gun
which
was
almost
musket
bore
and
loaded
it
with
a
good
charge
of
powder
and
with
two
slugs
and
laid
it
down
then
i
loaded
another
gun
with
two
bullets
and
the
third
for
we
had
three
pieces
i
loaded
with
five
smaller
bullets
i
took
the
best
aim
i
could
with
the
first
piece
to
have
shot
him
in
the
head
but
he
lay
so
with
his
leg
raised
a
little
above
his
nose
that
the
slugs
hit
his
leg
about
the
knee
and
broke
the
bone
he
started
up
growling
at
first
but
finding
his
leg
broken
fell
down
again
and
then
got
upon
three
legs
and
gave
the
most
hideous
roar
that
ever
i
heard
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
i
had
not
hit
him
on
the
head
however
i
took
up
the
second
piece
immediately
and
though
he
began
to
move
off
fired
again
and
shot
him
in
the
head
and
had
the
pleasure
to
see
him
drop
and
make
but
little
noise
but
lie
struggling
for
life
then
xury
took
heart
and
would
have
me
let
him
go
on
shore
well
go
said
i
so
the
boy
jumped
into
the
water
and
taking
a
little
gun
in
one
hand
swam
to
shore
with
the
other
hand
and
coming
close
to
the
creature
put
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
to
his
ear
and
shot
him
in
the
head
again
which
despatched
him
quite
this
was
game
indeed
to
us
but
this
was
no
food
and
i
was
very
sorry
to
lose
three
charges
of
powder
and
shot
upon
a
creature
that
was
good
for
nothing
to
us
however
xury
said
he
would
have
some
of
him
so
he
comes
on
board
and
asked
me
to
give
him
the
hatchet
for
what
xury
said
i
me
cut
off
his
head
said
he
however
xury
could
not
cut
off
his
head
but
he
cut
off
a
foot
and
brought
it
with
him
and
it
was
a
monstrous
great
one
i
bethought
myself
however
that
perhaps
the
skin
of
him
might
one
way
or
other
be
of
some
value
to
us
and
i
resolved
to
take
off
his
skin
if
i
could
so
xury
and
i
went
to
work
with
him
but
xury
was
much
the
better
workman
at
it
for
i
knew
very
ill
how
to
do
it
indeed
it
took
us
both
up
the
whole
day
but
at
last
we
got
off
the
hide
of
him
and
spreading
it
on
the
top
of
our
cabin
the
sun
effectually
dried
it
in
two
days
time
and
it
afterwards
served
me
to
lie
upon
chapter
iii
wrecked
on
a
desert
island
after
this
stop
we
made
on
to
the
southward
continually
for
ten
or
twelve
days
living
very
sparingly
on
our
provisions
which
began
to
abate
very
much
and
going
no
oftener
to
the
shore
than
we
were
obliged
to
for
fresh
water
my
design
in
this
was
to
make
the
river
gambia
or
senegal
that
is
to
say
anywhere
about
the
cape
de
verde
where
i
was
in
hopes
to
meet
with
some
european
ship
and
if
i
did
not
i
knew
not
what
course
i
had
to
take
but
to
seek
for
the
islands
or
perish
there
among
the
negroes
i
knew
that
all
the
ships
from
europe
which
sailed
either
to
the
coast
of
guinea
or
to
brazil
or
to
the
east
indies
made
this
cape
or
those
islands
and
in
a
word
i
put
the
whole
of
my
fortune
upon
this
single
point
either
that
i
must
meet
with
some
ship
or
must
perish
when
i
had
pursued
this
resolution
about
ten
days
longer
as
i
have
said
i
began
to
see
that
the
land
was
inhabited
and
in
two
or
three
places
as
we
sailed
by
we
saw
people
stand
upon
the
shore
to
look
at
us
we
could
also
perceive
they
were
quite
black
and
naked
i
was
once
inclined
to
have
gone
on
shore
to
them
but
xury
was
my
better
counsellor
and
said
to
me
no
go
no
go
however
i
hauled
in
nearer
the
shore
that
i
might
talk
to
them
and
i
found
they
ran
along
the
shore
by
me
a
good
way
i
observed
they
had
no
weapons
in
their
hand
except
one
who
had
a
long
slender
stick
which
xury
said
was
a
lance
and
that
they
could
throw
them
a
great
way
with
good
aim
so
i
kept
at
a
distance
but
talked
with
them
by
signs
as
well
as
i
could
and
particularly
made
signs
for
something
to
eat
they
beckoned
to
me
to
stop
my
boat
and
they
would
fetch
me
some
meat
upon
this
i
lowered
the
top
of
my
sail
and
lay
by
and
two
of
them
ran
up
into
the
country
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
came
back
and
brought
with
them
two
pieces
of
dried
flesh
and
some
corn
such
as
is
the
produce
of
their
country
but
we
neither
knew
what
the
one
or
the
other
was
however
we
were
willing
to
accept
it
but
how
to
come
at
it
was
our
next
dispute
for
i
would
not
venture
on
shore
to
them
and
they
were
as
much
afraid
of
us
but
they
took
a
safe
way
for
us
all
for
they
brought
it
to
the
shore
and
laid
it
down
and
went
and
stood
a
great
way
off
till
we
fetched
it
on
board
and
then
came
close
to
us
again
we
made
signs
of
thanks
to
them
for
we
had
nothing
to
make
them
amends
but
an
opportunity
offered
that
very
instant
to
oblige
them
wonderfully
for
while
we
were
lying
by
the
shore
came
two
mighty
creatures
one
pursuing
the
other
as
we
took
it
with
great
fury
from
the
mountains
towards
the
sea
whether
it
was
the
male
pursuing
the
female
or
whether
they
were
in
sport
or
in
rage
we
could
not
tell
any
more
than
we
could
tell
whether
it
was
usual
or
strange
but
i
believe
it
was
the
latter
because
in
the
first
place
those
ravenous
creatures
seldom
appear
but
in
the
night
and
in
the
second
place
we
found
the
people
terribly
frighted
especially
the
women
the
man
that
had
the
lance
or
dart
did
not
fly
from
them
but
the
rest
did
however
as
the
two
creatures
ran
directly
into
the
water
they
did
not
offer
to
fall
upon
any
of
the
negroes
but
plunged
themselves
into
the
sea
and
swam
about
as
if
they
had
come
for
their
diversion
at
last
one
of
them
began
to
come
nearer
our
boat
than
at
first
i
expected
but
i
lay
ready
for
him
for
i
had
loaded
my
gun
with
all
possible
expedition
and
bade
xury
load
both
the
others
as
soon
as
he
came
fairly
within
my
reach
i
fired
and
shot
him
directly
in
the
head
immediately
he
sank
down
into
the
water
but
rose
instantly
and
plunged
up
and
down
as
if
he
were
struggling
for
life
and
so
indeed
he
was
he
immediately
made
to
the
shore
but
between
the
wound
which
was
his
mortal
hurt
and
the
strangling
of
the
water
he
died
just
before
he
reached
the
shore
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
of
these
poor
creatures
at
the
noise
and
fire
of
my
gun
some
of
them
were
even
ready
to
die
for
fear
and
fell
down
as
dead
with
the
very
terror
but
when
they
saw
the
creature
dead
and
sunk
in
the
water
and
that
i
made
signs
to
them
to
come
to
the
shore
they
took
heart
and
came
and
began
to
search
for
the
creature
i
found
him
by
his
blood
staining
the
water
and
by
the
help
of
a
rope
which
i
slung
round
him
and
gave
the
negroes
to
haul
they
dragged
him
on
shore
and
found
that
it
was
a
most
curious
leopard
spotted
and
fine
to
an
admirable
degree
and
the
negroes
held
up
their
hands
with
admiration
to
think
what
it
was
i
had
killed
him
with
the
other
creature
frighted
with
the
flash
of
fire
and
the
noise
of
the
gun
swam
on
shore
and
ran
up
directly
to
the
mountains
from
whence
they
came
nor
could
i
at
that
distance
know
what
it
was
i
found
quickly
the
negroes
wished
to
eat
the
flesh
of
this
creature
so
i
was
willing
to
have
them
take
it
as
a
favour
from
me
which
when
i
made
signs
to
them
that
they
might
take
him
they
were
very
thankful
for
immediately
they
fell
to
work
with
him
and
though
they
had
no
knife
yet
with
a
sharpened
piece
of
wood
they
took
off
his
skin
as
readily
and
much
more
readily
than
we
could
have
done
with
a
knife
they
offered
me
some
of
the
flesh
which
i
declined
pointing
out
that
i
would
give
it
them
but
made
signs
for
the
skin
which
they
gave
me
very
freely
and
brought
me
a
great
deal
more
of
their
provisions
which
though
i
did
not
understand
yet
i
accepted
i
then
made
signs
to
them
for
some
water
and
held
out
one
of
my
jars
to
them
turning
it
bottom
upward
to
show
that
it
was
empty
and
that
i
wanted
to
have
it
filled
they
called
immediately
to
some
of
their
friends
and
there
came
two
women
and
brought
a
great
vessel
made
of
earth
and
burnt
as
i
supposed
in
the
sun
this
they
set
down
to
me
as
before
and
i
sent
xury
on
shore
with
my
jars
and
filled
them
all
three
the
women
were
as
naked
as
the
men
i
was
now
furnished
with
roots
and
corn
such
as
it
was
and
water
and
leaving
my
friendly
negroes
i
made
forward
for
about
eleven
days
more
without
offering
to
go
near
the
shore
till
i
saw
the
land
run
out
a
great
length
into
the
sea
at
about
the
distance
of
four
or
five
leagues
before
me
and
the
sea
being
very
calm
i
kept
a
large
offing
to
make
this
point
at
length
doubling
the
point
at
about
two
leagues
from
the
land
i
saw
plainly
land
on
the
other
side
to
seaward
then
i
concluded
as
it
was
most
certain
indeed
that
this
was
the
cape
de
verde
and
those
the
islands
called
from
thence
cape
de
verde
islands
however
they
were
at
a
great
distance
and
i
could
not
well
tell
what
i
had
best
to
do
for
if
i
should
be
taken
with
a
fresh
of
wind
i
might
neither
reach
one
or
other
in
this
dilemma
as
i
was
very
pensive
i
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
sat
down
xury
having
the
helm
when
on
a
sudden
the
boy
cried
out
master
master
a
ship
with
a
sail
and
the
foolish
boy
was
frighted
out
of
his
wits
thinking
it
must
needs
be
some
of
his
master
s
ships
sent
to
pursue
us
but
i
knew
we
were
far
enough
out
of
their
reach
i
jumped
out
of
the
cabin
and
immediately
saw
not
only
the
ship
but
that
it
was
a
portuguese
ship
and
as
i
thought
was
bound
to
the
coast
of
guinea
for
negroes
but
when
i
observed
the
course
she
steered
i
was
soon
convinced
they
were
bound
some
other
way
and
did
not
design
to
come
any
nearer
to
the
shore
upon
which
i
stretched
out
to
sea
as
much
as
i
could
resolving
to
speak
with
them
if
possible
with
all
the
sail
i
could
make
i
found
i
should
not
be
able
to
come
in
their
way
but
that
they
would
be
gone
by
before
i
could
make
any
signal
to
them
but
after
i
had
crowded
to
the
utmost
and
began
to
despair
they
it
seems
saw
by
the
help
of
their
glasses
that
it
was
some
european
boat
which
they
supposed
must
belong
to
some
ship
that
was
lost
so
they
shortened
sail
to
let
me
come
up
i
was
encouraged
with
this
and
as
i
had
my
patron
s
ancient
on
board
i
made
a
waft
of
it
to
them
for
a
signal
of
distress
and
fired
a
gun
both
which
they
saw
for
they
told
me
they
saw
the
smoke
though
they
did
not
hear
the
gun
upon
these
signals
they
very
kindly
brought
to
and
lay
by
for
me
and
in
about
three
hours
time
i
came
up
with
them
they
asked
me
what
i
was
in
portuguese
and
in
spanish
and
in
french
but
i
understood
none
of
them
but
at
last
a
scotch
sailor
who
was
on
board
called
to
me
and
i
answered
him
and
told
him
i
was
an
englishman
that
i
had
made
my
escape
out
of
slavery
from
the
moors
at
sallee
they
then
bade
me
come
on
board
and
very
kindly
took
me
in
and
all
my
goods
it
was
an
inexpressible
joy
to
me
which
any
one
will
believe
that
i
was
thus
delivered
as
i
esteemed
it
from
such
a
miserable
and
almost
hopeless
condition
as
i
was
in
and
i
immediately
offered
all
i
had
to
the
captain
of
the
ship
as
a
return
for
my
deliverance
but
he
generously
told
me
he
would
take
nothing
from
me
but
that
all
i
had
should
be
delivered
safe
to
me
when
i
came
to
the
brazils
for
says
he
i
have
saved
your
life
on
no
other
terms
than
i
would
be
glad
to
be
saved
myself
and
it
may
one
time
or
other
be
my
lot
to
be
taken
up
in
the
same
condition
besides
said
he
when
i
carry
you
to
the
brazils
so
great
a
way
from
your
own
country
if
i
should
take
from
you
what
you
have
you
will
be
starved
there
and
then
i
only
take
away
that
life
i
have
given
no
no
says
he
seignior
inglese
mr
englishman
i
will
carry
you
thither
in
charity
and
those
things
will
help
to
buy
your
subsistence
there
and
your
passage
home
again
as
he
was
charitable
in
this
proposal
so
he
was
just
in
the
performance
to
a
tittle
for
he
ordered
the
seamen
that
none
should
touch
anything
that
i
had
then
he
took
everything
into
his
own
possession
and
gave
me
back
an
exact
inventory
of
them
that
i
might
have
them
even
to
my
three
earthen
jars
as
to
my
boat
it
was
a
very
good
one
and
that
he
saw
and
told
me
he
would
buy
it
of
me
for
his
ship
s
use
and
asked
me
what
i
would
have
for
it
i
told
him
he
had
been
so
generous
to
me
in
everything
that
i
could
not
offer
to
make
any
price
of
the
boat
but
left
it
entirely
to
him
upon
which
he
told
me
he
would
give
me
a
note
of
hand
to
pay
me
eighty
pieces
of
eight
for
it
at
brazil
and
when
it
came
there
if
any
one
offered
to
give
more
he
would
make
it
up
he
offered
me
also
sixty
pieces
of
eight
more
for
my
boy
xury
which
i
was
loth
to
take
not
that
i
was
unwilling
to
let
the
captain
have
him
but
i
was
very
loth
to
sell
the
poor
boy
s
liberty
who
had
assisted
me
so
faithfully
in
procuring
my
own
however
when
i
let
him
know
my
reason
he
owned
it
to
be
just
and
offered
me
this
medium
that
he
would
give
the
boy
an
obligation
to
set
him
free
in
ten
years
if
he
turned
christian
upon
this
and
xury
saying
he
was
willing
to
go
to
him
i
let
the
captain
have
him
we
had
a
very
good
voyage
to
the
brazils
and
i
arrived
in
the
bay
de
todos
los
santos
or
all
saints
bay
in
about
twenty
two
days
after
and
now
i
was
once
more
delivered
from
the
most
miserable
of
all
conditions
of
life
and
what
to
do
next
with
myself
i
was
to
consider
the
generous
treatment
the
captain
gave
me
i
can
never
enough
remember
he
would
take
nothing
of
me
for
my
passage
gave
me
twenty
ducats
for
the
leopard
s
skin
and
forty
for
the
lion
s
skin
which
i
had
in
my
boat
and
caused
everything
i
had
in
the
ship
to
be
punctually
delivered
to
me
and
what
i
was
willing
to
sell
he
bought
of
me
such
as
the
case
of
bottles
two
of
my
guns
and
a
piece
of
the
lump
of
beeswax
for
i
had
made
candles
of
the
rest
in
a
word
i
made
about
two
hundred
and
twenty
pieces
of
eight
of
all
my
cargo
and
with
this
stock
i
went
on
shore
in
the
brazils
i
had
not
been
long
here
before
i
was
recommended
to
the
house
of
a
good
honest
man
like
himself
who
had
an
ingenio
as
they
call
it
that
is
a
plantation
and
a
sugar
house
i
lived
with
him
some
time
and
acquainted
myself
by
that
means
with
the
manner
of
planting
and
making
of
sugar
and
seeing
how
well
the
planters
lived
and
how
they
got
rich
suddenly
i
resolved
if
i
could
get
a
licence
to
settle
there
i
would
turn
planter
among
them
resolving
in
the
meantime
to
find
out
some
way
to
get
my
money
which
i
had
left
in
london
remitted
to
me
to
this
purpose
getting
a
kind
of
letter
of
naturalisation
i
purchased
as
much
land
that
was
uncured
as
my
money
would
reach
and
formed
a
plan
for
my
plantation
and
settlement
such
a
one
as
might
be
suitable
to
the
stock
which
i
proposed
to
myself
to
receive
from
england
i
had
a
neighbour
a
portuguese
of
lisbon
but
born
of
english
parents
whose
name
was
wells
and
in
much
such
circumstances
as
i
was
i
call
him
my
neighbour
because
his
plantation
lay
next
to
mine
and
we
went
on
very
sociably
together
my
stock
was
but
low
as
well
as
his
and
we
rather
planted
for
food
than
anything
else
for
about
two
years
however
we
began
to
increase
and
our
land
began
to
come
into
order
so
that
the
third
year
we
planted
some
tobacco
and
made
each
of
us
a
large
piece
of
ground
ready
for
planting
canes
in
the
year
to
come
but
we
both
wanted
help
and
now
i
found
more
than
before
i
had
done
wrong
in
parting
with
my
boy
xury
but
alas
for
me
to
do
wrong
that
never
did
right
was
no
great
wonder
i
hail
no
remedy
but
to
go
on
i
had
got
into
an
employment
quite
remote
to
my
genius
and
directly
contrary
to
the
life
i
delighted
in
and
for
which
i
forsook
my
father
s
house
and
broke
through
all
his
good
advice
nay
i
was
coming
into
the
very
middle
station
or
upper
degree
of
low
life
which
my
father
advised
me
to
before
and
which
if
i
resolved
to
go
on
with
i
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
never
have
fatigued
myself
in
the
world
as
i
had
done
and
i
used
often
to
say
to
myself
i
could
have
done
this
as
well
in
england
among
my
friends
as
have
gone
five
thousand
miles
off
to
do
it
among
strangers
and
savages
in
a
wilderness
and
at
such
a
distance
as
never
to
hear
from
any
part
of
the
world
that
had
the
least
knowledge
of
me
in
this
manner
i
used
to
look
upon
my
condition
with
the
utmost
regret
i
had
nobody
to
converse
with
but
now
and
then
this
neighbour
no
work
to
be
done
but
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
and
i
used
to
say
i
lived
just
like
a
man
cast
away
upon
some
desolate
island
that
had
nobody
there
but
himself
but
how
just
has
it
been
and
how
should
all
men
reflect
that
when
they
compare
their
present
conditions
with
others
that
are
worse
heaven
may
oblige
them
to
make
the
exchange
and
be
convinced
of
their
former
felicity
by
their
experience
i
say
how
just
has
it
been
that
the
truly
solitary
life
i
reflected
on
in
an
island
of
mere
desolation
should
be
my
lot
who
had
so
often
unjustly
compared
it
with
the
life
which
i
then
led
in
which
had
i
continued
i
had
in
all
probability
been
exceeding
prosperous
and
rich
i
was
in
some
degree
settled
in
my
measures
for
carrying
on
the
plantation
before
my
kind
friend
the
captain
of
the
ship
that
took
me
up
at
sea
went
back
for
the
ship
remained
there
in
providing
his
lading
and
preparing
for
his
voyage
nearly
three
months
when
telling
him
what
little
stock
i
had
left
behind
me
in
london
he
gave
me
this
friendly
and
sincere
advice
seignior
inglese
says
he
for
so
he
always
called
me
if
you
will
give
me
letters
and
a
procuration
in
form
to
me
with
orders
to
the
person
who
has
your
money
in
london
to
send
your
effects
to
lisbon
to
such
persons
as
i
shall
direct
and
in
such
goods
as
are
proper
for
this
country
i
will
bring
you
the
produce
of
them
god
willing
at
my
return
but
since
human
affairs
are
all
subject
to
changes
and
disasters
i
would
have
you
give
orders
but
for
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
which
you
say
is
half
your
stock
and
let
the
hazard
be
run
for
the
first
so
that
if
it
come
safe
you
may
order
the
rest
the
same
way
and
if
it
miscarry
you
may
have
the
other
half
to
have
recourse
to
for
your
supply
this
was
so
wholesome
advice
and
looked
so
friendly
that
i
could
not
but
be
convinced
it
was
the
best
course
i
could
take
so
i
accordingly
prepared
letters
to
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
i
had
left
my
money
and
a
procuration
to
the
portuguese
captain
as
he
desired
i
wrote
the
english
captain
s
widow
a
full
account
of
all
my
adventures
my
slavery
escape
and
how
i
had
met
with
the
portuguese
captain
at
sea
the
humanity
of
his
behaviour
and
what
condition
i
was
now
in
with
all
other
necessary
directions
for
my
supply
and
when
this
honest
captain
came
to
lisbon
he
found
means
by
some
of
the
english
merchants
there
to
send
over
not
the
order
only
but
a
full
account
of
my
story
to
a
merchant
in
london
who
represented
it
effectually
to
her
whereupon
she
not
only
delivered
the
money
but
out
of
her
own
pocket
sent
the
portugal
captain
a
very
handsome
present
for
his
humanity
and
charity
to
me
the
merchant
in
london
vesting
this
hundred
pounds
in
english
goods
such
as
the
captain
had
written
for
sent
them
directly
to
him
at
lisbon
and
he
brought
them
all
safe
to
me
to
the
brazils
among
which
without
my
direction
for
i
was
too
young
in
my
business
to
think
of
them
he
had
taken
care
to
have
all
sorts
of
tools
ironwork
and
utensils
necessary
for
my
plantation
and
which
were
of
great
use
to
me
when
this
cargo
arrived
i
thought
my
fortune
made
for
i
was
surprised
with
the
joy
of
it
and
my
stood
steward
the
captain
had
laid
out
the
five
pounds
which
my
friend
had
sent
him
for
a
present
for
himself
to
purchase
and
bring
me
over
a
servant
under
bond
for
six
years
service
and
would
not
accept
of
any
consideration
except
a
little
tobacco
which
i
would
have
him
accept
being
of
my
own
produce
neither
was
this
all
for
my
goods
being
all
english
manufacture
such
as
cloths
stuffs
baize
and
things
particularly
valuable
and
desirable
in
the
country
i
found
means
to
sell
them
to
a
very
great
advantage
so
that
i
might
say
i
had
more
than
four
times
the
value
of
my
first
cargo
and
was
now
infinitely
beyond
my
poor
neighbour
i
mean
in
the
advancement
of
my
plantation
for
the
first
thing
i
did
i
bought
me
a
negro
slave
and
an
european
servant
also
i
mean
another
besides
that
which
the
captain
brought
me
from
lisbon
but
as
abused
prosperity
is
oftentimes
made
the
very
means
of
our
greatest
adversity
so
it
was
with
me
i
went
on
the
next
year
with
great
success
in
my
plantation
i
raised
fifty
great
rolls
of
tobacco
on
my
own
ground
more
than
i
had
disposed
of
for
necessaries
among
my
neighbours
and
these
fifty
rolls
being
each
of
above
a
hundredweight
were
well
cured
and
laid
by
against
the
return
of
the
fleet
from
lisbon
and
now
increasing
in
business
and
wealth
my
head
began
to
be
full
of
projects
and
undertakings
beyond
my
reach
such
as
are
indeed
often
the
ruin
of
the
best
heads
in
business
had
i
continued
in
the
station
i
was
now
in
i
had
room
for
all
the
happy
things
to
have
yet
befallen
me
for
which
my
father
so
earnestly
recommended
a
quiet
retired
life
and
of
which
he
had
so
sensibly
described
the
middle
station
of
life
to
be
full
of
but
other
things
attended
me
and
i
was
still
to
be
the
wilful
agent
of
all
my
own
miseries
and
particularly
to
increase
my
fault
and
double
the
reflections
upon
myself
which
in
my
future
sorrows
i
should
have
leisure
to
make
all
these
miscarriages
were
procured
by
my
apparent
obstinate
adhering
to
my
foolish
inclination
of
wandering
abroad
and
pursuing
that
inclination
in
contradiction
to
the
clearest
views
of
doing
myself
good
in
a
fair
and
plain
pursuit
of
those
prospects
and
those
measures
of
life
which
nature
and
providence
concurred
to
present
me
with
and
to
make
my
duty
as
i
had
once
done
thus
in
my
breaking
away
from
my
parents
so
i
could
not
be
content
now
but
i
must
go
and
leave
the
happy
view
i
had
of
being
a
rich
and
thriving
man
in
my
new
plantation
only
to
pursue
a
rash
and
immoderate
desire
of
rising
faster
than
the
nature
of
the
thing
admitted
and
thus
i
cast
myself
down
again
into
the
deepest
gulf
of
human
misery
that
ever
man
fell
into
or
perhaps
could
be
consistent
with
life
and
a
state
of
health
in
the
world
to
come
then
by
the
just
degrees
to
the
particulars
of
this
part
of
my
story
you
may
suppose
that
having
now
lived
almost
four
years
in
the
brazils
and
beginning
to
thrive
and
prosper
very
well
upon
my
plantation
i
had
not
only
learned
the
language
but
had
contracted
acquaintance
and
friendship
among
my
fellow
planters
as
well
as
among
the
merchants
at
st
salvador
which
was
our
port
and
that
in
my
discourses
among
them
i
had
frequently
given
them
an
account
of
my
two
voyages
to
the
coast
of
guinea
the
manner
of
trading
with
the
negroes
there
and
how
easy
it
was
to
purchase
upon
the
coast
for
trifles
such
as
beads
toys
knives
scissors
hatchets
bits
of
glass
and
the
like
not
only
gold
dust
guinea
grains
elephants
teeth
c
but
negroes
for
the
service
of
the
brazils
in
great
numbers
they
listened
always
very
attentively
to
my
discourses
on
these
heads
but
especially
to
that
part
which
related
to
the
buying
of
negroes
which
was
a
trade
at
that
time
not
only
not
far
entered
into
but
as
far
as
it
was
had
been
carried
on
by
assientos
or
permission
of
the
kings
of
spain
and
portugal
and
engrossed
in
the
public
stock
so
that
few
negroes
were
bought
and
these
excessively
dear
it
happened
being
in
company
with
some
merchants
and
planters
of
my
acquaintance
and
talking
of
those
things
very
earnestly
three
of
them
came
to
me
next
morning
and
told
me
they
had
been
musing
very
much
upon
what
i
had
discoursed
with
them
of
the
last
night
and
they
came
to
make
a
secret
proposal
to
me
and
after
enjoining
me
to
secrecy
they
told
me
that
they
had
a
mind
to
fit
out
a
ship
to
go
to
guinea
that
they
had
all
plantations
as
well
as
i
and
were
straitened
for
nothing
so
much
as
servants
that
as
it
was
a
trade
that
could
not
be
carried
on
because
they
could
not
publicly
sell
the
negroes
when
they
came
home
so
they
desired
to
make
but
one
voyage
to
bring
the
negroes
on
shore
privately
and
divide
them
among
their
own
plantations
and
in
a
word
the
question
was
whether
i
would
go
their
supercargo
in
the
ship
to
manage
the
trading
part
upon
the
coast
of
guinea
and
they
offered
me
that
i
should
have
my
equal
share
of
the
negroes
without
providing
any
part
of
the
stock
this
was
a
fair
proposal
it
must
be
confessed
had
it
been
made
to
any
one
that
had
not
had
a
settlement
and
a
plantation
of
his
own
to
look
after
which
was
in
a
fair
way
of
coming
to
be
very
considerable
and
with
a
good
stock
upon
it
but
for
me
that
was
thus
entered
and
established
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
on
as
i
had
begun
for
three
or
four
years
more
and
to
have
sent
for
the
other
hundred
pounds
from
england
and
who
in
that
time
and
with
that
little
addition
could
scarce
have
failed
of
being
worth
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
increasing
too
for
me
to
think
of
such
a
voyage
was
the
most
preposterous
thing
that
ever
man
in
such
circumstances
could
be
guilty
of
but
i
that
was
born
to
be
my
own
destroyer
could
no
more
resist
the
offer
than
i
could
restrain
my
first
rambling
designs
when
my
father
good
counsel
was
lost
upon
me
in
a
word
i
told
them
i
would
go
with
all
my
heart
if
they
would
undertake
to
look
after
my
plantation
in
my
absence
and
would
dispose
of
it
to
such
as
i
should
direct
if
i
miscarried
this
they
all
engaged
to
do
and
entered
into
writings
or
covenants
to
do
so
and
i
made
a
formal
will
disposing
of
my
plantation
and
effects
in
case
of
my
death
making
the
captain
of
the
ship
that
had
saved
my
life
as
before
my
universal
heir
but
obliging
him
to
dispose
of
my
effects
as
i
had
directed
in
my
will
one
half
of
the
produce
being
to
himself
and
the
other
to
be
shipped
to
england
in
short
i
took
all
possible
caution
to
preserve
my
effects
and
to
keep
up
my
plantation
had
i
used
half
as
much
prudence
to
have
looked
into
my
own
interest
and
have
made
a
judgment
of
what
i
ought
to
have
done
and
not
to
have
done
i
had
certainly
never
gone
away
from
so
prosperous
an
undertaking
leaving
all
the
probable
views
of
a
thriving
circumstance
and
gone
upon
a
voyage
to
sea
attended
with
all
its
common
hazards
to
say
nothing
of
the
reasons
i
had
to
expect
particular
misfortunes
to
myself
but
i
was
hurried
on
and
obeyed
blindly
the
dictates
of
my
fancy
rather
than
my
reason
and
accordingly
the
ship
being
fitted
out
and
the
cargo
furnished
and
all
things
done
as
by
agreement
by
my
partners
in
the
voyage
i
went
on
board
in
an
evil
hour
the
st
september
being
the
same
day
eight
years
that
i
went
from
my
father
and
mother
at
hull
in
order
to
act
the
rebel
to
their
authority
and
the
fool
to
my
own
interests
our
ship
was
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
tons
burden
carried
six
guns
and
fourteen
men
besides
the
master
his
boy
and
myself
we
had
on
board
no
large
cargo
of
goods
except
of
such
toys
as
were
fit
for
our
trade
with
the
negroes
such
as
beads
bits
of
glass
shells
and
other
trifles
especially
little
looking
glasses
knives
scissors
hatchets
and
the
like
the
same
day
i
went
on
board
we
set
sail
standing
away
to
the
northward
upon
our
own
coast
with
design
to
stretch
over
for
the
african
coast
when
we
came
about
ten
or
twelve
degrees
of
northern
latitude
which
it
seems
was
the
manner
of
course
in
those
days
we
had
very
good
weather
only
excessively
hot
all
the
way
upon
our
own
coast
till
we
came
to
the
height
of
cape
st
augustino
from
whence
keeping
further
off
at
sea
we
lost
sight
of
land
and
steered
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
isle
fernando
de
noronha
holding
our
course
n
e
by
n
and
leaving
those
isles
on
the
east
in
this
course
we
passed
the
line
in
about
twelve
days
time
and
were
by
our
last
observation
in
seven
degrees
twenty
two
minutes
northern
latitude
when
a
violent
tornado
or
hurricane
took
us
quite
out
of
our
knowledge
it
began
from
the
south
east
came
about
to
the
north
west
and
then
settled
in
the
north
east
from
whence
it
blew
in
such
a
terrible
manner
that
for
twelve
days
together
we
could
do
nothing
but
drive
and
scudding
away
before
it
let
it
carry
us
whither
fate
and
the
fury
of
the
winds
directed
and
during
these
twelve
days
i
need
not
say
that
i
expected
every
day
to
be
swallowed
up
nor
indeed
did
any
in
the
ship
expect
to
save
their
lives
in
this
distress
we
had
besides
the
terror
of
the
storm
one
of
our
men
die
of
the
calenture
and
one
man
and
the
boy
washed
overboard
about
the
twelfth
day
the
weather
abating
a
little
the
master
made
an
observation
as
well
as
he
could
and
found
that
he
was
in
about
eleven
degrees
north
latitude
but
that
he
was
twenty
two
degrees
of
longitude
difference
west
from
cape
st
augustino
so
that
he
found
he
was
upon
the
coast
of
guiana
or
the
north
part
of
brazil
beyond
the
river
amazon
toward
that
of
the
river
orinoco
commonly
called
the
great
river
and
began
to
consult
with
me
what
course
he
should
take
for
the
ship
was
leaky
and
very
much
disabled
and
he
was
going
directly
back
to
the
coast
of
brazil
i
was
positively
against
that
and
looking
over
the
charts
of
the
sea
coast
of
america
with
him
we
concluded
there
was
no
inhabited
country
for
us
to
have
recourse
to
till
we
came
within
the
circle
of
the
caribbee
islands
and
therefore
resolved
to
stand
away
for
barbadoes
which
by
keeping
off
at
sea
to
avoid
the
indraft
of
the
bay
or
gulf
of
mexico
we
might
easily
perform
as
we
hoped
in
about
fifteen
days
sail
whereas
we
could
not
possibly
make
our
voyage
to
the
coast
of
africa
without
some
assistance
both
to
our
ship
and
to
ourselves
with
this
design
we
changed
our
course
and
steered
away
n
w
by
w
in
order
to
reach
some
of
our
english
islands
where
i
hoped
for
relief
but
our
voyage
was
otherwise
determined
for
being
in
the
latitude
of
twelve
degrees
eighteen
minutes
a
second
storm
came
upon
us
which
carried
us
away
with
the
same
impetuosity
westward
and
drove
us
so
out
of
the
way
of
all
human
commerce
that
had
all
our
lives
been
saved
as
to
the
sea
we
were
rather
in
danger
of
being
devoured
by
savages
than
ever
returning
to
our
own
country
in
this
distress
the
wind
still
blowing
very
hard
one
of
our
men
early
in
the
morning
cried
out
land
and
we
had
no
sooner
run
out
of
the
cabin
to
look
out
in
hopes
of
seeing
whereabouts
in
the
world
we
were
than
the
ship
struck
upon
a
sand
and
in
a
moment
her
motion
being
so
stopped
the
sea
broke
over
her
in
such
a
manner
that
we
expected
we
should
all
have
perished
immediately
and
we
were
immediately
driven
into
our
close
quarters
to
shelter
us
from
the
very
foam
and
spray
of
the
sea
it
is
not
easy
for
any
one
who
has
not
been
in
the
like
condition
to
describe
or
conceive
the
consternation
of
men
in
such
circumstances
we
knew
nothing
where
we
were
or
upon
what
land
it
was
we
were
driven
whether
an
island
or
the
main
whether
inhabited
or
not
inhabited
as
the
rage
of
the
wind
was
still
great
though
rather
less
than
at
first
we
could
not
so
much
as
hope
to
have
the
ship
hold
many
minutes
without
breaking
into
pieces
unless
the
winds
by
a
kind
of
miracle
should
turn
immediately
about
in
a
word
we
sat
looking
upon
one
another
and
expecting
death
every
moment
and
every
man
accordingly
preparing
for
another
world
for
there
was
little
or
nothing
more
for
us
to
do
in
this
that
which
was
our
present
comfort
and
all
the
comfort
we
had
was
that
contrary
to
our
expectation
the
ship
did
not
break
yet
and
that
the
master
said
the
wind
began
to
abate
now
though
we
thought
that
the
wind
did
a
little
abate
yet
the
ship
having
thus
struck
upon
the
sand
and
sticking
too
fast
for
us
to
expect
her
getting
off
we
were
in
a
dreadful
condition
indeed
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
of
saving
our
lives
as
well
as
we
could
we
had
a
boat
at
our
stern
just
before
the
storm
but
she
was
first
staved
by
dashing
against
the
ship
s
rudder
and
in
the
next
place
she
broke
away
and
either
sunk
or
was
driven
off
to
sea
so
there
was
no
hope
from
her
we
had
another
boat
on
board
but
how
to
get
her
off
into
the
sea
was
a
doubtful
thing
however
there
was
no
time
to
debate
for
we
fancied
that
the
ship
would
break
in
pieces
every
minute
and
some
told
us
she
was
actually
broken
already
in
this
distress
the
mate
of
our
vessel
laid
hold
of
the
boat
and
with
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
men
got
her
slung
over
the
ship
s
side
and
getting
all
into
her
let
go
and
committed
ourselves
being
eleven
in
number
to
god
s
mercy
and
the
wild
sea
for
though
the
storm
was
abated
considerably
yet
the
sea
ran
dreadfully
high
upon
the
shore
and
might
be
well
called
den
wild
zee
as
the
dutch
call
the
sea
in
a
storm
and
now
our
case
was
very
dismal
indeed
for
we
all
saw
plainly
that
the
sea
went
so
high
that
the
boat
could
not
live
and
that
we
should
be
inevitably
drowned
as
to
making
sail
we
had
none
nor
if
we
had
could
we
have
done
anything
with
it
so
we
worked
at
the
oar
towards
the
land
though
with
heavy
hearts
like
men
going
to
execution
for
we
all
knew
that
when
the
boat
came
near
the
shore
she
would
be
dashed
in
a
thousand
pieces
by
the
breach
of
the
sea
however
we
committed
our
souls
to
god
in
the
most
earnest
manner
and
the
wind
driving
us
towards
the
shore
we
hastened
our
destruction
with
our
own
hands
pulling
as
well
as
we
could
towards
land
what
the
shore
was
whether
rock
or
sand
whether
steep
or
shoal
we
knew
not
the
only
hope
that
could
rationally
give
us
the
least
shadow
of
expectation
was
if
we
might
find
some
bay
or
gulf
or
the
mouth
of
some
river
where
by
great
chance
we
might
have
run
our
boat
in
or
got
under
the
lee
of
the
land
and
perhaps
made
smooth
water
but
there
was
nothing
like
this
appeared
but
as
we
made
nearer
and
nearer
the
shore
the
land
looked
more
frightful
than
the
sea
after
we
had
rowed
or
rather
driven
about
a
league
and
a
half
as
we
reckoned
it
a
raging
wave
mountain
like
came
rolling
astern
of
us
and
plainly
bade
us
expect
the
coup
de
gr
ce
it
took
us
with
such
a
fury
that
it
overset
the
boat
at
once
and
separating
us
as
well
from
the
boat
as
from
one
another
gave
us
no
time
to
say
o
god
for
we
were
all
swallowed
up
in
a
moment
nothing
can
describe
the
confusion
of
thought
which
i
felt
when
i
sank
into
the
water
for
though
i
swam
very
well
yet
i
could
not
deliver
myself
from
the
waves
so
as
to
draw
breath
till
that
wave
having
driven
me
or
rather
carried
me
a
vast
way
on
towards
the
shore
and
having
spent
itself
went
back
and
left
me
upon
the
land
almost
dry
but
half
dead
with
the
water
i
took
in
i
had
so
much
presence
of
mind
as
well
as
breath
left
that
seeing
myself
nearer
the
mainland
than
i
expected
i
got
upon
my
feet
and
endeavoured
to
make
on
towards
the
land
as
fast
as
i
could
before
another
wave
should
return
and
take
me
up
again
but
i
soon
found
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
it
for
i
saw
the
sea
come
after
me
as
high
as
a
great
hill
and
as
furious
as
an
enemy
which
i
had
no
means
or
strength
to
contend
with
my
business
was
to
hold
my
breath
and
raise
myself
upon
the
water
if
i
could
and
so
by
swimming
to
preserve
my
breathing
and
pilot
myself
towards
the
shore
if
possible
my
greatest
concern
now
being
that
the
sea
as
it
would
carry
me
a
great
way
towards
the
shore
when
it
came
on
might
not
carry
me
back
again
with
it
when
it
gave
back
towards
the
sea
the
wave
that
came
upon
me
again
buried
me
at
once
twenty
or
thirty
feet
deep
in
its
own
body
and
i
could
feel
myself
carried
with
a
mighty
force
and
swiftness
towards
the
shore
a
very
great
way
but
i
held
my
breath
and
assisted
myself
to
swim
still
forward
with
all
my
might
i
was
ready
to
burst
with
holding
my
breath
when
as
i
felt
myself
rising
up
so
to
my
immediate
relief
i
found
my
head
and
hands
shoot
out
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
though
it
was
not
two
seconds
of
time
that
i
could
keep
myself
so
yet
it
relieved
me
greatly
gave
me
breath
and
new
courage
i
was
covered
again
with
water
a
good
while
but
not
so
long
but
i
held
it
out
and
finding
the
water
had
spent
itself
and
began
to
return
i
struck
forward
against
the
return
of
the
waves
and
felt
ground
again
with
my
feet
i
stood
still
a
few
moments
to
recover
breath
and
till
the
waters
went
from
me
and
then
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
with
what
strength
i
had
further
towards
the
shore
but
neither
would
this
deliver
me
from
the
fury
of
the
sea
which
came
pouring
in
after
me
again
and
twice
more
i
was
lifted
up
by
the
waves
and
carried
forward
as
before
the
shore
being
very
flat
the
last
time
of
these
two
had
well
nigh
been
fatal
to
me
for
the
sea
having
hurried
me
along
as
before
landed
me
or
rather
dashed
me
against
a
piece
of
rock
and
that
with
such
force
that
it
left
me
senseless
and
indeed
helpless
as
to
my
own
deliverance
for
the
blow
taking
my
side
and
breast
beat
the
breath
as
it
were
quite
out
of
my
body
and
had
it
returned
again
immediately
i
must
have
been
strangled
in
the
water
but
i
recovered
a
little
before
the
return
of
the
waves
and
seeing
i
should
be
covered
again
with
the
water
i
resolved
to
hold
fast
by
a
piece
of
the
rock
and
so
to
hold
my
breath
if
possible
till
the
wave
went
back
now
as
the
waves
were
not
so
high
as
at
first
being
nearer
land
i
held
my
hold
till
the
wave
abated
and
then
fetched
another
run
which
brought
me
so
near
the
shore
that
the
next
wave
though
it
went
over
me
yet
did
not
so
swallow
me
up
as
to
carry
me
away
and
the
next
run
i
took
i
got
to
the
mainland
where
to
my
great
comfort
i
clambered
up
the
cliffs
of
the
shore
and
sat
me
down
upon
the
grass
free
from
danger
and
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
i
was
now
landed
and
safe
on
shore
and
began
to
look
up
and
thank
god
that
my
life
was
saved
in
a
case
wherein
there
was
some
minutes
before
scarce
any
room
to
hope
i
believe
it
is
impossible
to
express
to
the
life
what
the
ecstasies
and
transports
of
the
soul
are
when
it
is
so
saved
as
i
may
say
out
of
the
very
grave
and
i
do
not
wonder
now
at
the
custom
when
a
malefactor
who
has
the
halter
about
his
neck
is
tied
up
and
just
going
to
be
turned
off
and
has
a
reprieve
brought
to
him
i
say
i
do
not
wonder
that
they
bring
a
surgeon
with
it
to
let
him
blood
that
very
moment
they
tell
him
of
it
that
the
surprise
may
not
drive
the
animal
spirits
from
the
heart
and
overwhelm
him
for
sudden
joys
like
griefs
confound
at
first
i
walked
about
on
the
shore
lifting
up
my
hands
and
my
whole
being
as
i
may
say
wrapped
up
in
a
contemplation
of
my
deliverance
making
a
thousand
gestures
and
motions
which
i
cannot
describe
reflecting
upon
all
my
comrades
that
were
drowned
and
that
there
should
not
be
one
soul
saved
but
myself
for
as
for
them
i
never
saw
them
afterwards
or
any
sign
of
them
except
three
of
their
hats
one
cap
and
two
shoes
that
were
not
fellows
i
cast
my
eye
to
the
stranded
vessel
when
the
breach
and
froth
of
the
sea
being
so
big
i
could
hardly
see
it
it
lay
so
far
of
and
considered
lord
how
was
it
possible
i
could
get
on
shore
after
i
had
solaced
my
mind
with
the
comfortable
part
of
my
condition
i
began
to
look
round
me
to
see
what
kind
of
place
i
was
in
and
what
was
next
to
be
done
and
i
soon
found
my
comforts
abate
and
that
in
a
word
i
had
a
dreadful
deliverance
for
i
was
wet
had
no
clothes
to
shift
me
nor
anything
either
to
eat
or
drink
to
comfort
me
neither
did
i
see
any
prospect
before
me
but
that
of
perishing
with
hunger
or
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
and
that
which
was
particularly
afflicting
to
me
was
that
i
had
no
weapon
either
to
hunt
and
kill
any
creature
for
my
sustenance
or
to
defend
myself
against
any
other
creature
that
might
desire
to
kill
me
for
theirs
in
a
word
i
had
nothing
about
me
but
a
knife
a
tobacco
pipe
and
a
little
tobacco
in
a
box
this
was
all
my
provisions
and
this
threw
me
into
such
terrible
agonies
of
mind
that
for
a
while
i
ran
about
like
a
madman
night
coming
upon
me
i
began
with
a
heavy
heart
to
consider
what
would
be
my
lot
if
there
were
any
ravenous
beasts
in
that
country
as
at
night
they
always
come
abroad
for
their
prey
all
the
remedy
that
offered
to
my
thoughts
at
that
time
was
to
get
up
into
a
thick
bushy
tree
like
a
fir
but
thorny
which
grew
near
me
and
where
i
resolved
to
sit
all
night
and
consider
the
next
day
what
death
i
should
die
for
as
yet
i
saw
no
prospect
of
life
i
walked
about
a
furlong
from
the
shore
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
fresh
water
to
drink
which
i
did
to
my
great
joy
and
having
drank
and
put
a
little
tobacco
into
my
mouth
to
prevent
hunger
i
went
to
the
tree
and
getting
up
into
it
endeavoured
to
place
myself
so
that
if
i
should
sleep
i
might
not
fall
and
having
cut
me
a
short
stick
like
a
truncheon
for
my
defence
i
took
up
my
lodging
and
having
been
excessively
fatigued
i
fell
fast
asleep
and
slept
as
comfortably
as
i
believe
few
could
have
done
in
my
condition
and
found
myself
more
refreshed
with
it
than
i
think
i
ever
was
on
such
an
occasion
chapter
iv
first
weeks
on
the
island
when
i
waked
it
was
broad
day
the
weather
clear
and
the
storm
abated
so
that
the
sea
did
not
rage
and
swell
as
before
but
that
which
surprised
me
most
was
that
the
ship
was
lifted
off
in
the
night
from
the
sand
where
she
lay
by
the
swelling
of
the
tide
and
was
driven
up
almost
as
far
as
the
rock
which
i
at
first
mentioned
where
i
had
been
so
bruised
by
the
wave
dashing
me
against
it
this
being
within
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
where
i
was
and
the
ship
seeming
to
stand
upright
still
i
wished
myself
on
board
that
at
least
i
might
save
some
necessary
things
for
my
use
when
i
came
down
from
my
apartment
in
the
tree
i
looked
about
me
again
and
the
first
thing
i
found
was
the
boat
which
lay
as
the
wind
and
the
sea
had
tossed
her
up
upon
the
land
about
two
miles
on
my
right
hand
i
walked
as
far
as
i
could
upon
the
shore
to
have
got
to
her
but
found
a
neck
or
inlet
of
water
between
me
and
the
boat
which
was
about
half
a
mile
broad
so
i
came
back
for
the
present
being
more
intent
upon
getting
at
the
ship
where
i
hoped
to
find
something
for
my
present
subsistence
a
little
after
noon
i
found
the
sea
very
calm
and
the
tide
ebbed
so
far
out
that
i
could
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
ship
and
here
i
found
a
fresh
renewing
of
my
grief
for
i
saw
evidently
that
if
we
had
kept
on
board
we
had
been
all
safe
that
is
to
say
we
had
all
got
safe
on
shore
and
i
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
to
be
left
entirety
destitute
of
all
comfort
and
company
as
i
now
was
this
forced
tears
to
my
eyes
again
but
as
there
was
little
relief
in
that
i
resolved
if
possible
to
get
to
the
ship
so
i
pulled
off
my
clothes
for
the
weather
was
hot
to
extremity
and
took
the
water
but
when
i
came
to
the
ship
my
difficulty
was
still
greater
to
know
how
to
get
on
board
for
as
she
lay
aground
and
high
out
of
the
water
there
was
nothing
within
my
reach
to
lay
hold
of
i
swam
round
her
twice
and
the
second
time
i
spied
a
small
piece
of
rope
which
i
wondered
i
did
not
see
at
first
hung
down
by
the
fore
chains
so
low
as
that
with
great
difficulty
i
got
hold
of
it
and
by
the
help
of
that
rope
i
got
up
into
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
here
i
found
that
the
ship
was
bulged
and
had
a
great
deal
of
water
in
her
hold
but
that
she
lay
so
on
the
side
of
a
bank
of
hard
sand
or
rather
earth
that
her
stern
lay
lifted
up
upon
the
bank
and
her
head
low
almost
to
the
water
by
this
means
all
her
quarter
was
free
and
all
that
was
in
that
part
was
dry
for
you
may
be
sure
my
first
work
was
to
search
and
to
see
what
was
spoiled
and
what
was
free
and
first
i
found
that
all
the
ship
s
provisions
were
dry
and
untouched
by
the
water
and
being
very
well
disposed
to
eat
i
went
to
the
bread
room
and
filled
my
pockets
with
biscuit
and
ate
it
as
i
went
about
other
things
for
i
had
no
time
to
lose
i
also
found
some
rum
in
the
great
cabin
of
which
i
took
a
large
dram
and
which
i
had
indeed
need
enough
of
to
spirit
me
for
what
was
before
me
now
i
wanted
nothing
but
a
boat
to
furnish
myself
with
many
things
which
i
foresaw
would
be
very
necessary
to
me
it
was
in
vain
to
sit
still
and
wish
for
what
was
not
to
be
had
and
this
extremity
roused
my
application
we
had
several
spare
yards
and
two
or
three
large
spars
of
wood
and
a
spare
topmast
or
two
in
the
ship
i
resolved
to
fall
to
work
with
these
and
i
flung
as
many
of
them
overboard
as
i
could
manage
for
their
weight
tying
every
one
with
a
rope
that
they
might
not
drive
away
when
this
was
done
i
went
down
the
ship
s
side
and
pulling
them
to
me
i
tied
four
of
them
together
at
both
ends
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
form
of
a
raft
and
laying
two
or
three
short
pieces
of
plank
upon
them
crossways
i
found
i
could
walk
upon
it
very
well
but
that
it
was
not
able
to
bear
any
great
weight
the
pieces
being
too
light
so
i
went
to
work
and
with
a
carpenter
s
saw
i
cut
a
spare
topmast
into
three
lengths
and
added
them
to
my
raft
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
pains
but
the
hope
of
furnishing
myself
with
necessaries
encouraged
me
to
go
beyond
what
i
should
have
been
able
to
have
done
upon
another
occasion
my
raft
was
now
strong
enough
to
bear
any
reasonable
weight
my
next
care
was
what
to
load
it
with
and
how
to
preserve
what
i
laid
upon
it
from
the
surf
of
the
sea
but
i
was
not
long
considering
this
i
first
laid
all
the
planks
or
boards
upon
it
that
i
could
get
and
having
considered
well
what
i
most
wanted
i
got
three
of
the
seamen
s
chests
which
i
had
broken
open
and
emptied
and
lowered
them
down
upon
my
raft
the
first
of
these
i
filled
with
provisions
viz
bread
rice
three
dutch
cheeses
five
pieces
of
dried
goat
s
flesh
which
we
lived
much
upon
and
a
little
remainder
of
european
corn
which
had
been
laid
by
for
some
fowls
which
we
brought
to
sea
with
us
but
the
fowls
were
killed
there
had
been
some
barley
and
wheat
together
but
to
my
great
disappointment
i
found
afterwards
that
the
rats
had
eaten
or
spoiled
it
all
as
for
liquors
i
found
several
cases
of
bottles
belonging
to
our
skipper
in
which
were
some
cordial
waters
and
in
all
about
five
or
six
gallons
of
rack
these
i
stowed
by
themselves
there
being
no
need
to
put
them
into
the
chest
nor
any
room
for
them
while
i
was
doing
this
i
found
the
tide
begin
to
flow
though
very
calm
and
i
had
the
mortification
to
see
my
coat
shirt
and
waistcoat
which
i
had
left
on
the
shore
upon
the
sand
swim
away
as
for
my
breeches
which
were
only
linen
and
open
kneed
i
swam
on
board
in
them
and
my
stockings
however
this
set
me
on
rummaging
for
clothes
of
which
i
found
enough
but
took
no
more
than
i
wanted
for
present
use
for
i
had
others
things
which
my
eye
was
more
upon
as
first
tools
to
work
with
on
shore
and
it
was
after
long
searching
that
i
found
out
the
carpenter
s
chest
which
was
indeed
a
very
useful
prize
to
me
and
much
more
valuable
than
a
shipload
of
gold
would
have
been
at
that
time
i
got
it
down
to
my
raft
whole
as
it
was
without
losing
time
to
look
into
it
for
i
knew
in
general
what
it
contained
my
next
care
was
for
some
ammunition
and
arms
there
were
two
very
good
fowling
pieces
in
the
great
cabin
and
two
pistols
these
i
secured
first
with
some
powder
horns
and
a
small
bag
of
shot
and
two
old
rusty
swords
i
knew
there
were
three
barrels
of
powder
in
the
ship
but
knew
not
where
our
gunner
had
stowed
them
but
with
much
search
i
found
them
two
of
them
dry
and
good
the
third
had
taken
water
those
two
i
got
to
my
raft
with
the
arms
and
now
i
thought
myself
pretty
well
freighted
and
began
to
think
how
i
should
get
to
shore
with
them
having
neither
sail
oar
nor
rudder
and
the
least
capful
of
wind
would
have
overset
all
my
navigation
i
had
three
encouragements
st
a
smooth
calm
sea
ndly
the
tide
rising
and
setting
in
to
the
shore
rdly
what
little
wind
there
was
blew
me
towards
the
land
and
thus
having
found
two
or
three
broken
oars
belonging
to
the
boat
and
besides
the
tools
which
were
in
the
chest
i
found
two
saws
an
axe
and
a
hammer
with
this
cargo
i
put
to
sea
for
a
mile
or
thereabouts
my
raft
went
very
well
only
that
i
found
it
drive
a
little
distant
from
the
place
where
i
had
landed
before
by
which
i
perceived
that
there
was
some
indraft
of
the
water
and
consequently
i
hoped
to
find
some
creek
or
river
there
which
i
might
make
use
of
as
a
port
to
get
to
land
with
my
cargo
as
i
imagined
so
it
was
there
appeared
before
me
a
little
opening
of
the
land
and
i
found
a
strong
current
of
the
tide
set
into
it
so
i
guided
my
raft
as
well
as
i
could
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
but
here
i
had
like
to
have
suffered
a
second
shipwreck
which
if
i
had
i
think
verily
would
have
broken
my
heart
for
knowing
nothing
of
the
coast
my
raft
ran
aground
at
one
end
of
it
upon
a
shoal
and
not
being
aground
at
the
other
end
it
wanted
but
a
little
that
all
my
cargo
had
slipped
off
towards
the
end
that
was
afloat
and
to
fallen
into
the
water
i
did
my
utmost
by
setting
my
back
against
the
chests
to
keep
them
in
their
places
but
could
not
thrust
off
the
raft
with
all
my
strength
neither
durst
i
stir
from
the
posture
i
was
in
but
holding
up
the
chests
with
all
my
might
i
stood
in
that
manner
near
half
an
hour
in
which
time
the
rising
of
the
water
brought
me
a
little
more
upon
a
level
and
a
little
after
the
water
still
rising
my
raft
floated
again
and
i
thrust
her
off
with
the
oar
i
had
into
the
channel
and
then
driving
up
higher
i
at
length
found
myself
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
with
land
on
both
sides
and
a
strong
current
of
tide
running
up
i
looked
on
both
sides
for
a
proper
place
to
get
to
shore
for
i
was
not
willing
to
be
driven
too
high
up
the
river
hoping
in
time
to
see
some
ships
at
sea
and
therefore
resolved
to
place
myself
as
near
the
coast
as
i
could
at
length
i
spied
a
little
cove
on
the
right
shore
of
the
creek
to
which
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
i
guided
my
raft
and
at
last
got
so
near
that
reaching
ground
with
my
oar
i
could
thrust
her
directly
in
but
here
i
had
like
to
have
dipped
all
my
cargo
into
the
sea
again
for
that
shore
lying
pretty
steep
that
is
to
say
sloping
there
was
no
place
to
land
but
where
one
end
of
my
float
if
it
ran
on
shore
would
lie
so
high
and
the
other
sink
lower
as
before
that
it
would
endanger
my
cargo
again
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
wait
till
the
tide
was
at
the
highest
keeping
the
raft
with
my
oar
like
an
anchor
to
hold
the
side
of
it
fast
to
the
shore
near
a
flat
piece
of
ground
which
i
expected
the
water
would
flow
over
and
so
it
did
as
soon
as
i
found
water
enough
for
my
raft
drew
about
a
foot
of
water
i
thrust
her
upon
that
flat
piece
of
ground
and
there
fastened
or
moored
her
by
sticking
my
two
broken
oars
into
the
ground
one
on
one
side
near
one
end
and
one
on
the
other
side
near
the
other
end
and
thus
i
lay
till
the
water
ebbed
away
and
left
my
raft
and
all
my
cargo
safe
on
shore
my
next
work
was
to
view
the
country
and
seek
a
proper
place
for
my
habitation
and
where
to
stow
my
goods
to
secure
them
from
whatever
might
happen
where
i
was
i
yet
knew
not
whether
on
the
continent
or
on
an
island
whether
inhabited
or
not
inhabited
whether
in
danger
of
wild
beasts
or
not
there
was
a
hill
not
above
a
mile
from
me
which
rose
up
very
steep
and
high
and
which
seemed
to
overtop
some
other
hills
which
lay
as
in
a
ridge
from
it
northward
i
took
out
one
of
the
fowling
pieces
and
one
of
the
pistols
and
a
horn
of
powder
and
thus
armed
i
travelled
for
discovery
up
to
the
top
of
that
hill
where
after
i
had
with
great
labour
and
difficulty
got
to
the
top
i
saw
my
fate
to
my
great
affliction
viz
that
i
was
in
an
island
environed
every
way
with
the
sea
no
land
to
be
seen
except
some
rocks
which
lay
a
great
way
off
and
two
small
islands
less
than
this
which
lay
about
three
leagues
to
the
west
i
found
also
that
the
island
i
was
in
was
barren
and
as
i
saw
good
reason
to
believe
uninhabited
except
by
wild
beasts
of
whom
however
i
saw
none
yet
i
saw
abundance
of
fowls
but
knew
not
their
kinds
neither
when
i
killed
them
could
i
tell
what
was
fit
for
food
and
what
not
at
my
coming
back
i
shot
at
a
great
bird
which
i
saw
sitting
upon
a
tree
on
the
side
of
a
great
wood
i
believe
it
was
the
first
gun
that
had
been
fired
there
since
the
creation
of
the
world
i
had
no
sooner
fired
than
from
all
parts
of
the
wood
there
arose
an
innumerable
number
of
fowls
of
many
sorts
making
a
confused
screaming
and
crying
and
every
one
according
to
his
usual
note
but
not
one
of
them
of
any
kind
that
i
knew
as
for
the
creature
i
killed
i
took
it
to
be
a
kind
of
hawk
its
colour
and
beak
resembling
it
but
it
had
no
talons
or
claws
more
than
common
its
flesh
was
carrion
and
fit
for
nothing
contented
with
this
discovery
i
came
back
to
my
raft
and
fell
to
work
to
bring
my
cargo
on
shore
which
took
me
up
the
rest
of
that
day
what
to
do
with
myself
at
night
i
knew
not
nor
indeed
where
to
rest
for
i
was
afraid
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
not
knowing
but
some
wild
beast
might
devour
me
though
as
i
afterwards
found
there
was
really
no
need
for
those
fears
however
as
well
as
i
could
i
barricaded
myself
round
with
the
chest
and
boards
that
i
had
brought
on
shore
and
made
a
kind
of
hut
for
that
night
s
lodging
as
for
food
i
yet
saw
not
which
way
to
supply
myself
except
that
i
had
seen
two
or
three
creatures
like
hares
run
out
of
the
wood
where
i
shot
the
fowl
i
now
began
to
consider
that
i
might
yet
get
a
great
many
things
out
of
the
ship
which
would
be
useful
to
me
and
particularly
some
of
the
rigging
and
sails
and
such
other
things
as
might
come
to
land
and
i
resolved
to
make
another
voyage
on
board
the
vessel
if
possible
and
as
i
knew
that
the
first
storm
that
blew
must
necessarily
break
her
all
in
pieces
i
resolved
to
set
all
other
things
apart
till
i
had
got
everything
out
of
the
ship
that
i
could
get
then
i
called
a
council
that
is
to
say
in
my
thoughts
whether
i
should
take
back
the
raft
but
this
appeared
impracticable
so
i
resolved
to
go
as
before
when
the
tide
was
down
and
i
did
so
only
that
i
stripped
before
i
went
from
my
hut
having
nothing
on
but
my
chequered
shirt
a
pair
of
linen
drawers
and
a
pair
of
pumps
on
my
feet
i
got
on
board
the
ship
as
before
and
prepared
a
second
raft
and
having
had
experience
of
the
first
i
neither
made
this
so
unwieldy
nor
loaded
it
so
hard
but
yet
i
brought
away
several
things
very
useful
to
me
as
first
in
the
carpenters
stores
i
found
two
or
three
bags
full
of
nails
and
spikes
a
great
screw
jack
a
dozen
or
two
of
hatchets
and
above
all
that
most
useful
thing
called
a
grindstone
all
these
i
secured
together
with
several
things
belonging
to
the
gunner
particularly
two
or
three
iron
crows
and
two
barrels
of
musket
bullets
seven
muskets
another
fowling
piece
with
some
small
quantity
of
powder
more
a
large
bagful
of
small
shot
and
a
great
roll
of
sheet
lead
but
this
last
was
so
heavy
i
could
not
hoist
it
up
to
get
it
over
the
ship
s
side
besides
these
things
i
took
all
the
men
s
clothes
that
i
could
find
and
a
spare
fore
topsail
a
hammock
and
some
bedding
and
with
this
i
loaded
my
second
raft
and
brought
them
all
safe
on
shore
to
my
very
great
comfort
i
was
under
some
apprehension
during
my
absence
from
the
land
that
at
least
my
provisions
might
be
devoured
on
shore
but
when
i
came
back
i
found
no
sign
of
any
visitor
only
there
sat
a
creature
like
a
wild
cat
upon
one
of
the
chests
which
when
i
came
towards
it
ran
away
a
little
distance
and
then
stood
still
she
sat
very
composed
and
unconcerned
and
looked
full
in
my
face
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
be
acquainted
with
me
i
presented
my
gun
at
her
but
as
she
did
not
understand
it
she
was
perfectly
unconcerned
at
it
nor
did
she
offer
to
stir
away
upon
which
i
tossed
her
a
bit
of
biscuit
though
by
the
way
i
was
not
very
free
of
it
for
my
store
was
not
great
however
i
spared
her
a
bit
i
say
and
she
went
to
it
smelled
at
it
and
ate
it
and
looked
as
if
pleased
for
more
but
i
thanked
her
and
could
spare
no
more
so
she
marched
off
having
got
my
second
cargo
on
shore
though
i
was
fain
to
open
the
barrels
of
powder
and
bring
them
by
parcels
for
they
were
too
heavy
being
large
casks
i
went
to
work
to
make
me
a
little
tent
with
the
sail
and
some
poles
which
i
cut
for
that
purpose
and
into
this
tent
i
brought
everything
that
i
knew
would
spoil
either
with
rain
or
sun
and
i
piled
all
the
empty
chests
and
casks
up
in
a
circle
round
the
tent
to
fortify
it
from
any
sudden
attempt
either
from
man
or
beast
when
i
had
done
this
i
blocked
up
the
door
of
the
tent
with
some
boards
within
and
an
empty
chest
set
up
on
end
without
and
spreading
one
of
the
beds
upon
the
ground
laying
my
two
pistols
just
at
my
head
and
my
gun
at
length
by
me
i
went
to
bed
for
the
first
time
and
slept
very
quietly
all
night
for
i
was
very
weary
and
heavy
for
the
night
before
i
had
slept
little
and
had
laboured
very
hard
all
day
to
fetch
all
those
things
from
the
ship
and
to
get
them
on
shore
i
had
the
biggest
magazine
of
all
kinds
now
that
ever
was
laid
up
i
believe
for
one
man
but
i
was
not
satisfied
still
for
while
the
ship
sat
upright
in
that
posture
i
thought
i
ought
to
get
everything
out
of
her
that
i
could
so
every
day
at
low
water
i
went
on
board
and
brought
away
something
or
other
but
particularly
the
third
time
i
went
i
brought
away
as
much
of
the
rigging
as
i
could
as
also
all
the
small
ropes
and
rope
twine
i
could
get
with
a
piece
of
spare
canvas
which
was
to
mend
the
sails
upon
occasion
and
the
barrel
of
wet
gunpowder
in
a
word
i
brought
away
all
the
sails
first
and
last
only
that
i
was
fain
to
cut
them
in
pieces
and
bring
as
much
at
a
time
as
i
could
for
they
were
no
more
useful
to
be
sails
but
as
mere
canvas
only
but
that
which
comforted
me
more
still
was
that
last
of
all
after
i
had
made
five
or
six
such
voyages
as
these
and
thought
i
had
nothing
more
to
expect
from
the
ship
that
was
worth
my
meddling
with
i
say
after
all
this
i
found
a
great
hogshead
of
bread
three
large
runlets
of
rum
or
spirits
a
box
of
sugar
and
a
barrel
of
fine
flour
this
was
surprising
to
me
because
i
had
given
over
expecting
any
more
provisions
except
what
was
spoiled
by
the
water
i
soon
emptied
the
hogshead
of
the
bread
and
wrapped
it
up
parcel
by
parcel
in
pieces
of
the
sails
which
i
cut
out
and
in
a
word
i
got
all
this
safe
on
shore
also
the
next
day
i
made
another
voyage
and
now
having
plundered
the
ship
of
what
was
portable
and
fit
to
hand
out
i
began
with
the
cables
cutting
the
great
cable
into
pieces
such
as
i
could
move
i
got
two
cables
and
a
hawser
on
shore
with
all
the
ironwork
i
could
get
and
having
cut
down
the
spritsail
yard
and
the
mizzen
yard
and
everything
i
could
to
make
a
large
raft
i
loaded
it
with
all
these
heavy
goods
and
came
away
but
my
good
luck
began
now
to
leave
me
for
this
raft
was
so
unwieldy
and
so
overladen
that
after
i
had
entered
the
little
cove
where
i
had
landed
the
rest
of
my
goods
not
being
able
to
guide
it
so
handily
as
i
did
the
other
it
overset
and
threw
me
and
all
my
cargo
into
the
water
as
for
myself
it
was
no
great
harm
for
i
was
near
the
shore
but
as
to
my
cargo
it
was
a
great
part
of
it
lost
especially
the
iron
which
i
expected
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
me
however
when
the
tide
was
out
i
got
most
of
the
pieces
of
the
cable
ashore
and
some
of
the
iron
though
with
infinite
labour
for
i
was
fain
to
dip
for
it
into
the
water
a
work
which
fatigued
me
very
much
after
this
i
went
every
day
on
board
and
brought
away
what
i
could
get
i
had
been
now
thirteen
days
on
shore
and
had
been
eleven
times
on
board
the
ship
in
which
time
i
had
brought
away
all
that
one
pair
of
hands
could
well
be
supposed
capable
to
bring
though
i
believe
verily
had
the
calm
weather
held
i
should
have
brought
away
the
whole
ship
piece
by
piece
but
preparing
the
twelfth
time
to
go
on
board
i
found
the
wind
began
to
rise
however
at
low
water
i
went
on
board
and
though
i
thought
i
had
rummaged
the
cabin
so
effectually
that
nothing
more
could
be
found
yet
i
discovered
a
locker
with
drawers
in
it
in
one
of
which
i
found
two
or
three
razors
and
one
pair
of
large
scissors
with
some
ten
or
a
dozen
of
good
knives
and
forks
in
another
i
found
about
thirty
six
pounds
value
in
money
some
european
coin
some
brazil
some
pieces
of
eight
some
gold
and
some
silver
i
smiled
to
myself
at
the
sight
of
this
money
o
drug
said
i
aloud
what
art
thou
good
for
thou
art
not
worth
to
me
no
not
the
taking
off
the
ground
one
of
those
knives
is
worth
all
this
heap
i
have
no
manner
of
use
for
thee
e
en
remain
where
thou
art
and
go
to
the
bottom
as
a
creature
whose
life
is
not
worth
saying
however
upon
second
thoughts
i
took
it
away
and
wrapping
all
this
in
a
piece
of
canvas
i
began
to
think
of
making
another
raft
but
while
i
was
preparing
this
i
found
the
sky
overcast
and
the
wind
began
to
rise
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
blew
a
fresh
gale
from
the
shore
it
presently
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
in
vain
to
pretend
to
make
a
raft
with
the
wind
offshore
and
that
it
was
my
business
to
be
gone
before
the
tide
of
flood
began
otherwise
i
might
not
be
able
to
reach
the
shore
at
all
accordingly
i
let
myself
down
into
the
water
and
swam
across
the
channel
which
lay
between
the
ship
and
the
sands
and
even
that
with
difficulty
enough
partly
with
the
weight
of
the
things
i
had
about
me
and
partly
the
roughness
of
the
water
for
the
wind
rose
very
hastily
and
before
it
was
quite
high
water
it
blew
a
storm
but
i
had
got
home
to
my
little
tent
where
i
lay
with
all
my
wealth
about
me
very
secure
it
blew
very
hard
all
night
and
in
the
morning
when
i
looked
out
behold
no
more
ship
was
to
be
seen
i
was
a
little
surprised
but
recovered
myself
with
the
satisfactory
reflection
that
i
had
lost
no
time
nor
abated
any
diligence
to
get
everything
out
of
her
that
could
be
useful
to
me
and
that
indeed
there
was
little
left
in
her
that
i
was
able
to
bring
away
if
i
had
had
more
time
i
now
gave
over
any
more
thoughts
of
the
ship
or
of
anything
out
of
her
except
what
might
drive
on
shore
from
her
wreck
as
indeed
divers
pieces
of
her
afterwards
did
but
those
things
were
of
small
use
to
me
my
thoughts
were
now
wholly
employed
about
securing
myself
against
either
savages
if
any
should
appear
or
wild
beasts
if
any
were
in
the
island
and
i
had
many
thoughts
of
the
method
how
to
do
this
and
what
kind
of
dwelling
to
make
whether
i
should
make
me
a
cave
in
the
earth
or
a
tent
upon
the
earth
and
in
short
i
resolved
upon
both
the
manner
and
description
of
which
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
an
account
of
i
soon
found
the
place
i
was
in
was
not
fit
for
my
settlement
because
it
was
upon
a
low
moorish
ground
near
the
sea
and
i
believed
it
would
not
be
wholesome
and
more
particularly
because
there
was
no
fresh
water
near
it
so
i
resolved
to
find
a
more
healthy
and
more
convenient
spot
of
ground
i
consulted
several
things
in
my
situation
which
i
found
would
he
proper
for
me
st
health
and
fresh
water
i
just
now
mentioned
ndly
shelter
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
rdly
security
from
ravenous
creatures
whether
man
or
beast
thly
a
view
to
the
sea
that
if
god
sent
any
ship
in
sight
i
might
not
lose
any
advantage
for
my
deliverance
of
which
i
was
not
willing
to
banish
all
my
expectation
yet
in
search
of
a
place
proper
for
this
i
found
a
little
plain
on
the
side
of
a
rising
hill
whose
front
towards
this
little
plain
was
steep
as
a
house
side
so
that
nothing
could
come
down
upon
me
from
the
top
on
the
one
side
of
the
rock
there
was
a
hollow
place
worn
a
little
way
in
like
the
entrance
or
door
of
a
cave
but
there
was
not
really
any
cave
or
way
into
the
rock
at
all
on
the
flat
of
the
green
just
before
this
hollow
place
i
resolved
to
pitch
my
tent
this
plain
was
not
above
a
hundred
yards
broad
and
about
twice
as
long
and
lay
like
a
green
before
my
door
and
at
the
end
of
it
descended
irregularly
every
way
down
into
the
low
ground
by
the
seaside
it
was
on
the
n
n
w
side
of
the
hill
so
that
it
was
sheltered
from
the
heat
every
day
till
it
came
to
a
w
and
by
s
sun
or
thereabouts
which
in
those
countries
is
near
the
setting
before
i
set
up
my
tent
i
drew
a
half
circle
before
the
hollow
place
which
took
in
about
ten
yards
in
its
semi
diameter
from
the
rock
and
twenty
yards
in
its
diameter
from
its
beginning
and
ending
in
this
half
circle
i
pitched
two
rows
of
strong
stakes
driving
them
into
the
ground
till
they
stood
very
firm
like
piles
the
biggest
end
being
out
of
the
ground
above
five
feet
and
a
half
and
sharpened
on
the
top
the
two
rows
did
not
stand
above
six
inches
from
one
another
then
i
took
the
pieces
of
cable
which
i
had
cut
in
the
ship
and
laid
them
in
rows
one
upon
another
within
the
circle
between
these
two
rows
of
stakes
up
to
the
top
placing
other
stakes
in
the
inside
leaning
against
them
about
two
feet
and
a
half
high
like
a
spur
to
a
post
and
this
fence
was
so
strong
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
get
into
it
or
over
it
this
cost
me
a
great
deal
of
time
and
labour
especially
to
cut
the
piles
in
the
woods
bring
them
to
the
place
and
drive
them
into
the
earth
the
entrance
into
this
place
i
made
to
be
not
by
a
door
but
by
a
short
ladder
to
go
over
the
top
which
ladder
when
i
was
in
i
lifted
over
after
me
and
so
i
was
completely
fenced
in
and
fortified
as
i
thought
from
all
the
world
and
consequently
slept
secure
in
the
night
which
otherwise
i
could
not
have
done
though
as
it
appeared
afterwards
there
was
no
need
of
all
this
caution
from
the
enemies
that
i
apprehended
danger
from
into
this
fence
or
fortress
with
infinite
labour
i
carried
all
my
riches
all
my
provisions
ammunition
and
stores
of
which
you
have
the
account
above
and
i
made
a
large
tent
which
to
preserve
me
from
the
rains
that
in
one
part
of
the
year
are
very
violent
there
i
made
double
one
smaller
tent
within
and
one
larger
tent
above
it
and
covered
the
uppermost
with
a
large
tarpaulin
which
i
had
saved
among
the
sails
and
now
i
lay
no
more
for
a
while
in
the
bed
which
i
had
brought
on
shore
but
in
a
hammock
which
was
indeed
a
very
good
one
and
belonged
to
the
mate
of
the
ship
into
this
tent
i
brought
all
my
provisions
and
everything
that
would
spoil
by
the
wet
and
having
thus
enclosed
all
my
goods
i
made
up
the
entrance
which
till
now
i
had
left
open
and
so
passed
and
repassed
as
i
said
by
a
short
ladder
when
i
had
done
this
i
began
to
work
my
way
into
the
rock
and
bringing
all
the
earth
and
stones
that
i
dug
down
out
through
my
tent
i
laid
them
up
within
my
fence
in
the
nature
of
a
terrace
so
that
it
raised
the
ground
within
about
a
foot
and
a
half
and
thus
i
made
me
a
cave
just
behind
my
tent
which
served
me
like
a
cellar
to
my
house
it
cost
me
much
labour
and
many
days
before
all
these
things
were
brought
to
perfection
and
therefore
i
must
go
back
to
some
other
things
which
took
up
some
of
my
thoughts
at
the
same
time
it
happened
after
i
had
laid
my
scheme
for
the
setting
up
my
tent
and
making
the
cave
that
a
storm
of
rain
falling
from
a
thick
dark
cloud
a
sudden
flash
of
lightning
happened
and
after
that
a
great
clap
of
thunder
as
is
naturally
the
effect
of
it
i
was
not
so
much
surprised
with
the
lightning
as
i
was
with
the
thought
which
darted
into
my
mind
as
swift
as
the
lightning
itself
oh
my
powder
my
very
heart
sank
within
me
when
i
thought
that
at
one
blast
all
my
powder
might
be
destroyed
on
which
not
my
defence
only
but
the
providing
my
food
as
i
thought
entirely
depended
i
was
nothing
near
so
anxious
about
my
own
danger
though
had
the
powder
took
fire
i
should
never
have
known
who
had
hurt
me
such
impression
did
this
make
upon
me
that
after
the
storm
was
over
i
laid
aside
all
my
works
my
building
and
fortifying
and
applied
myself
to
make
bags
and
boxes
to
separate
the
powder
and
to
keep
it
a
little
and
a
little
in
a
parcel
in
the
hope
that
whatever
might
come
it
might
not
all
take
fire
at
once
and
to
keep
it
so
apart
that
it
should
not
be
possible
to
make
one
part
fire
another
i
finished
this
work
in
about
a
fortnight
and
i
think
my
powder
which
in
all
was
about
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
weight
was
divided
in
not
less
than
a
hundred
parcels
as
to
the
barrel
that
had
been
wet
i
did
not
apprehend
any
danger
from
that
so
i
placed
it
in
my
new
cave
which
in
my
fancy
i
called
my
kitchen
and
the
rest
i
hid
up
and
down
in
holes
among
the
rocks
so
that
no
wet
might
come
to
it
marking
very
carefully
where
i
laid
it
in
the
interval
of
time
while
this
was
doing
i
went
out
once
at
least
every
day
with
my
gun
as
well
to
divert
myself
as
to
see
if
i
could
kill
anything
fit
for
food
and
as
near
as
i
could
to
acquaint
myself
with
what
the
island
produced
the
first
time
i
went
out
i
presently
discovered
that
there
were
goats
in
the
island
which
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
but
then
it
was
attended
with
this
misfortune
to
me
viz
that
they
were
so
shy
so
subtle
and
so
swift
of
foot
that
it
was
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
come
at
them
but
i
was
not
discouraged
at
this
not
doubting
but
i
might
now
and
then
shoot
one
as
it
soon
happened
for
after
i
had
found
their
haunts
a
little
i
laid
wait
in
this
manner
for
them
i
observed
if
they
saw
me
in
the
valleys
though
they
were
upon
the
rocks
they
would
run
away
as
in
a
terrible
fright
but
if
they
were
feeding
in
the
valleys
and
i
was
upon
the
rocks
they
took
no
notice
of
me
from
whence
i
concluded
that
by
the
position
of
their
optics
their
sight
was
so
directed
downward
that
they
did
not
readily
see
objects
that
were
above
them
so
afterwards
i
took
this
method
i
always
climbed
the
rocks
first
to
get
above
them
and
then
had
frequently
a
fair
mark
the
first
shot
i
made
among
these
creatures
i
killed
a
she
goat
which
had
a
little
kid
by
her
which
she
gave
suck
to
which
grieved
me
heartily
for
when
the
old
one
fell
the
kid
stood
stock
still
by
her
till
i
came
and
took
her
up
and
not
only
so
but
when
i
carried
the
old
one
with
me
upon
my
shoulders
the
kid
followed
me
quite
to
my
enclosure
upon
which
i
laid
down
the
dam
and
took
the
kid
in
my
arms
and
carried
it
over
my
pale
in
hopes
to
have
bred
it
up
tame
but
it
would
not
eat
so
i
was
forced
to
kill
it
and
eat
it
myself
these
two
supplied
me
with
flesh
a
great
while
for
i
ate
sparingly
and
saved
my
provisions
my
bread
especially
as
much
as
possibly
i
could
having
now
fixed
my
habitation
i
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
provide
a
place
to
make
a
fire
in
and
fuel
to
burn
and
what
i
did
for
that
and
also
how
i
enlarged
my
cave
and
what
conveniences
i
made
i
shall
give
a
full
account
of
in
its
place
but
i
must
now
give
some
little
account
of
myself
and
of
my
thoughts
about
living
which
it
may
well
be
supposed
were
not
a
few
i
had
a
dismal
prospect
of
my
condition
for
as
i
was
not
cast
away
upon
that
island
without
being
driven
as
is
said
by
a
violent
storm
quite
out
of
the
course
of
our
intended
voyage
and
a
great
way
viz
some
hundreds
of
leagues
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
the
trade
of
mankind
i
had
great
reason
to
consider
it
as
a
determination
of
heaven
that
in
this
desolate
place
and
in
this
desolate
manner
i
should
end
my
life
the
tears
would
run
plentifully
down
my
face
when
i
made
these
reflections
and
sometimes
i
would
expostulate
with
myself
why
providence
should
thus
completely
ruin
his
creatures
and
render
them
so
absolutely
miserable
so
without
help
abandoned
so
entirely
depressed
that
it
could
hardly
be
rational
to
be
thankful
for
such
a
life
but
something
always
returned
swift
upon
me
to
check
these
thoughts
and
to
reprove
me
and
particularly
one
day
walking
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
by
the
seaside
i
was
very
pensive
upon
the
subject
of
my
present
condition
when
reason
as
it
were
expostulated
with
me
the
other
way
thus
well
you
are
in
a
desolate
condition
it
is
true
but
pray
remember
where
are
the
rest
of
you
did
not
you
come
eleven
of
you
in
the
boat
where
are
the
ten
why
were
they
not
saved
and
you
lost
why
were
you
singled
out
is
it
better
to
be
here
or
there
and
then
i
pointed
to
the
sea
all
evils
are
to
be
considered
with
the
good
that
is
in
them
and
with
what
worse
attends
them
then
it
occurred
to
me
again
how
well
i
was
furnished
for
my
subsistence
and
what
would
have
been
my
case
if
it
had
not
happened
which
was
a
hundred
thousand
to
one
that
the
ship
floated
from
the
place
where
she
first
struck
and
was
driven
so
near
to
the
shore
that
i
had
time
to
get
all
these
things
out
of
her
what
would
have
been
my
case
if
i
had
been
forced
to
have
lived
in
the
condition
in
which
i
at
first
came
on
shore
without
necessaries
of
life
or
necessaries
to
supply
and
procure
them
particularly
said
i
aloud
though
to
myself
what
should
i
have
done
without
a
gun
without
ammunition
without
any
tools
to
make
anything
or
to
work
with
without
clothes
bedding
a
tent
or
any
manner
of
covering
and
that
now
i
had
all
these
to
sufficient
quantity
and
was
in
a
fair
way
to
provide
myself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
live
without
my
gun
when
my
ammunition
was
spent
so
that
i
had
a
tolerable
view
of
subsisting
without
any
want
as
long
as
i
lived
for
i
considered
from
the
beginning
how
i
would
provide
for
the
accidents
that
might
happen
and
for
the
time
that
was
to
come
even
not
only
after
my
ammunition
should
be
spent
but
even
after
my
health
and
strength
should
decay
i
confess
i
had
not
entertained
any
notion
of
my
ammunition
being
destroyed
at
one
blast
i
mean
my
powder
being
blown
up
by
lightning
and
this
made
the
thoughts
of
it
so
surprising
to
me
when
it
lightened
and
thundered
as
i
observed
just
now
and
now
being
about
to
enter
into
a
melancholy
relation
of
a
scene
of
silent
life
such
perhaps
as
was
never
heard
of
in
the
world
before
i
shall
take
it
from
its
beginning
and
continue
it
in
its
order
it
was
by
my
account
the
th
of
september
when
in
the
manner
as
above
said
i
first
set
foot
upon
this
horrid
island
when
the
sun
being
to
us
in
its
autumnal
equinox
was
almost
over
my
head
for
i
reckoned
myself
by
observation
to
be
in
the
latitude
of
nine
degrees
twenty
two
minutes
north
of
the
line
after
i
had
been
there
about
ten
or
twelve
days
it
came
into
my
thoughts
that
i
should
lose
my
reckoning
of
time
for
want
of
books
and
pen
and
ink
and
should
even
forget
the
sabbath
days
but
to
prevent
this
i
cut
with
my
knife
upon
a
large
post
in
capital
letters
and
making
it
into
a
great
cross
i
set
it
up
on
the
shore
where
i
first
landed
i
came
on
shore
here
on
the
th
september
upon
the
sides
of
this
square
post
i
cut
every
day
a
notch
with
my
knife
and
every
seventh
notch
was
as
long
again
as
the
rest
and
every
first
day
of
the
month
as
long
again
as
that
long
one
and
thus
i
kept
my
calendar
or
weekly
monthly
and
yearly
reckoning
of
time
in
the
next
place
we
are
to
observe
that
among
the
many
things
which
i
brought
out
of
the
ship
in
the
several
voyages
which
as
above
mentioned
i
made
to
it
i
got
several
things
of
less
value
but
not
at
all
less
useful
to
me
which
i
omitted
setting
down
before
as
in
particular
pens
ink
and
paper
several
parcels
in
the
captain
s
mate
s
gunner
s
and
carpenter
s
keeping
three
or
four
compasses
some
mathematical
instruments
dials
perspectives
charts
and
books
of
navigation
all
which
i
huddled
together
whether
i
might
want
them
or
no
also
i
found
three
very
good
bibles
which
came
to
me
in
my
cargo
from
england
and
which
i
had
packed
up
among
my
things
some
portuguese
books
also
and
among
them
two
or
three
popish
prayer
books
and
several
other
books
all
which
i
carefully
secured
and
i
must
not
forget
that
we
had
in
the
ship
a
dog
and
two
cats
of
whose
eminent
history
i
may
have
occasion
to
say
something
in
its
place
for
i
carried
both
the
cats
with
me
and
as
for
the
dog
he
jumped
out
of
the
ship
of
himself
and
swam
on
shore
to
me
the
day
after
i
went
on
shore
with
my
first
cargo
and
was
a
trusty
servant
to
me
many
years
i
wanted
nothing
that
he
could
fetch
me
nor
any
company
that
he
could
make
up
to
me
i
only
wanted
to
have
him
talk
to
me
but
that
would
not
do
as
i
observed
before
i
found
pens
ink
and
paper
and
i
husbanded
them
to
the
utmost
and
i
shall
show
that
while
my
ink
lasted
i
kept
things
very
exact
but
after
that
was
gone
i
could
not
for
i
could
not
make
any
ink
by
any
means
that
i
could
devise
and
this
put
me
in
mind
that
i
wanted
many
things
notwithstanding
all
that
i
had
amassed
together
and
of
these
ink
was
one
as
also
a
spade
pickaxe
and
shovel
to
dig
or
remove
the
earth
needles
pins
and
thread
as
for
linen
i
soon
learned
to
want
that
without
much
difficulty
this
want
of
tools
made
every
work
i
did
go
on
heavily
and
it
was
near
a
whole
year
before
i
had
entirely
finished
my
little
pale
or
surrounded
my
habitation
the
piles
or
stakes
which
were
as
heavy
as
i
could
well
lift
were
a
long
time
in
cutting
and
preparing
in
the
woods
and
more
by
far
in
bringing
home
so
that
i
spent
sometimes
two
days
in
cutting
and
bringing
home
one
of
those
posts
and
a
third
day
in
driving
it
into
the
ground
for
which
purpose
i
got
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
at
first
but
at
last
bethought
myself
of
one
of
the
iron
crows
which
however
though
i
found
it
made
driving
those
posts
or
piles
very
laborious
and
tedious
work
but
what
need
i
have
been
concerned
at
the
tediousness
of
anything
i
had
to
do
seeing
i
had
time
enough
to
do
it
in
nor
had
i
any
other
employment
if
that
had
been
over
at
least
that
i
could
foresee
except
the
ranging
the
island
to
seek
for
food
which
i
did
more
or
less
every
day
i
now
began
to
consider
seriously
my
condition
and
the
circumstances
i
was
reduced
to
and
i
drew
up
the
state
of
my
affairs
in
writing
not
so
much
to
leave
them
to
any
that
were
to
come
after
me
for
i
was
likely
to
have
but
few
heirs
as
to
deliver
my
thoughts
from
daily
poring
over
them
and
afflicting
my
mind
and
as
my
reason
began
now
to
master
my
despondency
i
began
to
comfort
myself
as
well
as
i
could
and
to
set
the
good
against
the
evil
that
i
might
have
something
to
distinguish
my
case
from
worse
and
i
stated
very
impartially
like
debtor
and
creditor
the
comforts
i
enjoyed
against
the
miseries
i
suffered
thus
evil
good
i
am
cast
upon
a
horrible
but
i
am
alive
and
not
drowned
desolate
island
void
of
all
hope
as
all
my
ship
s
company
were
of
recovery
i
am
singled
out
and
separated
but
i
am
singled
out
too
from
as
it
were
from
all
the
world
all
the
ship
s
crew
to
be
spared
to
be
miserable
from
death
and
he
that
miraculously
saved
me
from
death
can
deliver
me
from
this
condition
i
am
divided
from
mankind
a
but
i
am
not
starved
and
solitaire
one
banished
from
perishing
on
a
barren
place
human
society
affording
no
sustenance
i
have
no
clothes
to
cover
me
but
i
am
in
a
hot
climate
where
if
i
had
clothes
i
could
hardly
wear
them
i
am
without
any
defence
or
but
i
am
cast
on
an
island
where
means
to
resist
any
violence
of
i
see
no
wild
beasts
to
hurt
me
man
or
beast
as
i
saw
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
what
if
i
had
been
shipwrecked
there
i
have
no
soul
to
speak
to
or
but
god
wonderfully
sent
the
ship
relieve
me
in
near
enough
to
the
shore
that
i
have
got
out
as
many
necessary
things
as
will
either
supply
my
wants
or
enable
me
to
supply
myself
even
as
long
as
i
live
upon
the
whole
here
was
an
undoubted
testimony
that
there
was
scarce
any
condition
in
the
world
so
miserable
but
there
was
something
negative
or
something
positive
to
be
thankful
for
in
it
and
let
this
stand
as
a
direction
from
the
experience
of
the
most
miserable
of
all
conditions
in
this
world
that
we
may
always
find
in
it
something
to
comfort
ourselves
from
and
to
set
in
the
description
of
good
and
evil
on
the
credit
side
of
the
account
having
now
brought
my
mind
a
little
to
relish
my
condition
and
given
over
looking
out
to
sea
to
see
if
i
could
spy
a
ship
i
say
giving
over
these
things
i
began
to
apply
myself
to
arrange
my
way
of
living
and
to
make
things
as
easy
to
me
as
i
could
i
have
already
described
my
habitation
which
was
a
tent
under
the
side
of
a
rock
surrounded
with
a
strong
pale
of
posts
and
cables
but
i
might
now
rather
call
it
a
wall
for
i
raised
a
kind
of
wall
up
against
it
of
turfs
about
two
feet
thick
on
the
outside
and
after
some
time
i
think
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
i
raised
rafters
from
it
leaning
to
the
rock
and
thatched
or
covered
it
with
boughs
of
trees
and
such
things
as
i
could
get
to
keep
out
the
rain
which
i
found
at
some
times
of
the
year
very
violent
i
have
already
observed
how
i
brought
all
my
goods
into
this
pale
and
into
the
cave
which
i
had
made
behind
me
but
i
must
observe
too
that
at
first
this
was
a
confused
heap
of
goods
which
as
they
lay
in
no
order
so
they
took
up
all
my
place
i
had
no
room
to
turn
myself
so
i
set
myself
to
enlarge
my
cave
and
work
farther
into
the
earth
for
it
was
a
loose
sandy
rock
which
yielded
easily
to
the
labour
i
bestowed
on
it
and
so
when
i
found
i
was
pretty
safe
as
to
beasts
of
prey
i
worked
sideways
to
the
right
hand
into
the
rock
and
then
turning
to
the
right
again
worked
quite
out
and
made
me
a
door
to
come
out
on
the
outside
of
my
pale
or
fortification
this
gave
me
not
only
egress
and
regress
as
it
was
a
back
way
to
my
tent
and
to
my
storehouse
but
gave
me
room
to
store
my
goods
and
now
i
began
to
apply
myself
to
make
such
necessary
things
as
i
found
i
most
wanted
particularly
a
chair
and
a
table
for
without
these
i
was
not
able
to
enjoy
the
few
comforts
i
had
in
the
world
i
could
not
write
or
eat
or
do
several
things
with
so
much
pleasure
without
a
table
so
i
went
to
work
and
here
i
must
needs
observe
that
as
reason
is
the
substance
and
origin
of
the
mathematics
so
by
stating
and
squaring
everything
by
reason
and
by
making
the
most
rational
judgment
of
things
every
man
may
be
in
time
master
of
every
mechanic
art
i
had
never
handled
a
tool
in
my
life
and
yet
in
time
by
labour
application
and
contrivance
i
found
at
last
that
i
wanted
nothing
but
i
could
have
made
it
especially
if
i
had
had
tools
however
i
made
abundance
of
things
even
without
tools
and
some
with
no
more
tools
than
an
adze
and
a
hatchet
which
perhaps
were
never
made
that
way
before
and
that
with
infinite
labour
for
example
if
i
wanted
a
board
i
had
no
other
way
but
to
cut
down
a
tree
set
it
on
an
edge
before
me
and
hew
it
flat
on
either
side
with
my
axe
till
i
brought
it
to
be
thin
as
a
plank
and
then
dub
it
smooth
with
my
adze
it
is
true
by
this
method
i
could
make
but
one
board
out
of
a
whole
tree
but
this
i
had
no
remedy
for
but
patience
any
more
than
i
had
for
the
prodigious
deal
of
time
and
labour
which
it
took
me
up
to
make
a
plank
or
board
but
my
time
or
labour
was
little
worth
and
so
it
was
as
well
employed
one
way
as
another
however
i
made
me
a
table
and
a
chair
as
i
observed
above
in
the
first
place
and
this
i
did
out
of
the
short
pieces
of
boards
that
i
brought
on
my
raft
from
the
ship
but
when
i
had
wrought
out
some
boards
as
above
i
made
large
shelves
of
the
breadth
of
a
foot
and
a
half
one
over
another
all
along
one
side
of
my
cave
to
lay
all
my
tools
nails
and
ironwork
on
and
in
a
word
to
separate
everything
at
large
into
their
places
that
i
might
come
easily
at
them
i
knocked
pieces
into
the
wall
of
the
rock
to
hang
my
guns
and
all
things
that
would
hang
up
so
that
had
my
cave
been
to
be
seen
it
looked
like
a
general
magazine
of
all
necessary
things
and
had
everything
so
ready
at
my
hand
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
all
my
goods
in
such
order
and
especially
to
find
my
stock
of
all
necessaries
so
great
and
now
it
was
that
i
began
to
keep
a
journal
of
every
day
s
employment
for
indeed
at
first
i
was
in
too
much
hurry
and
not
only
hurry
as
to
labour
but
in
too
much
discomposure
of
mind
and
my
journal
would
have
been
full
of
many
dull
things
for
example
i
must
have
said
thus
th
after
i
had
got
to
shore
and
escaped
drowning
instead
of
being
thankful
to
god
for
my
deliverance
having
first
vomited
with
the
great
quantity
of
salt
water
which
had
got
into
my
stomach
and
recovering
myself
a
little
i
ran
about
the
shore
wringing
my
hands
and
beating
my
head
and
face
exclaiming
at
my
misery
and
crying
out
i
was
undone
undone
till
tired
and
faint
i
was
forced
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
to
repose
but
durst
not
sleep
for
fear
of
being
devoured
some
days
after
this
and
after
i
had
been
on
board
the
ship
and
got
all
that
i
could
out
of
her
yet
i
could
not
forbear
getting
up
to
the
top
of
a
little
mountain
and
looking
out
to
sea
in
hopes
of
seeing
a
ship
then
fancy
at
a
vast
distance
i
spied
a
sail
please
myself
with
the
hopes
of
it
and
then
after
looking
steadily
till
i
was
almost
blind
lose
it
quite
and
sit
down
and
weep
like
a
child
and
thus
increase
my
misery
by
my
folly
but
having
gotten
over
these
things
in
some
measure
and
having
settled
my
household
staff
and
habitation
made
me
a
table
and
a
chair
and
all
as
handsome
about
me
as
i
could
i
began
to
keep
my
journal
of
which
i
shall
here
give
you
the
copy
though
in
it
will
be
told
all
these
particulars
over
again
as
long
as
it
lasted
for
having
no
more
ink
i
was
forced
to
leave
it
off
chapter
v
builds
a
house
the
journal
september
i
poor
miserable
robinson
crusoe
being
shipwrecked
during
a
dreadful
storm
in
the
offing
came
on
shore
on
this
dismal
unfortunate
island
which
i
called
the
island
of
despair
all
the
rest
of
the
ship
s
company
being
drowned
and
myself
almost
dead
all
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
in
afflicting
myself
at
the
dismal
circumstances
i
was
brought
to
viz
i
had
neither
food
house
clothes
weapon
nor
place
to
fly
to
and
in
despair
of
any
relief
saw
nothing
but
death
before
me
either
that
i
should
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
murdered
by
savages
or
starved
to
death
for
want
of
food
at
the
approach
of
night
i
slept
in
a
tree
for
fear
of
wild
creatures
but
slept
soundly
though
it
rained
all
night
october
in
the
morning
i
saw
to
my
great
surprise
the
ship
had
floated
with
the
high
tide
and
was
driven
on
shore
again
much
nearer
the
island
which
as
it
was
some
comfort
on
one
hand
for
seeing
her
set
upright
and
not
broken
to
pieces
i
hoped
if
the
wind
abated
i
might
get
on
board
and
get
some
food
and
necessaries
out
of
her
for
my
relief
so
on
the
other
hand
it
renewed
my
grief
at
the
loss
of
my
comrades
who
i
imagined
if
we
had
all
stayed
on
board
might
have
saved
the
ship
or
at
least
that
they
would
not
have
been
all
drowned
as
they
were
and
that
had
the
men
been
saved
we
might
perhaps
have
built
us
a
boat
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
ship
to
have
carried
us
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
i
spent
great
part
of
this
day
in
perplexing
myself
on
these
things
but
at
length
seeing
the
ship
almost
dry
i
went
upon
the
sand
as
near
as
i
could
and
then
swam
on
board
this
day
also
it
continued
raining
though
with
no
wind
at
all
from
the
st
of
october
to
the
th
all
these
days
entirely
spent
in
many
several
voyages
to
get
all
i
could
out
of
the
ship
which
i
brought
on
shore
every
tide
of
flood
upon
rafts
much
rain
also
in
the
days
though
with
some
intervals
of
fair
weather
but
it
seems
this
was
the
rainy
season
oct
i
overset
my
raft
and
all
the
goods
i
had
got
upon
it
but
being
in
shoal
water
and
the
things
being
chiefly
heavy
i
recovered
many
of
them
when
the
tide
was
out
oct
it
rained
all
night
and
all
day
with
some
gusts
of
wind
during
which
time
the
ship
broke
in
pieces
the
wind
blowing
a
little
harder
than
before
and
was
no
more
to
be
seen
except
the
wreck
of
her
and
that
only
at
low
water
i
spent
this
day
in
covering
and
securing
the
goods
which
i
had
saved
that
the
rain
might
not
spoil
them
oct
i
walked
about
the
shore
almost
all
day
to
find
out
a
place
to
fix
my
habitation
greatly
concerned
to
secure
myself
from
any
attack
in
the
night
either
from
wild
beasts
or
men
towards
night
i
fixed
upon
a
proper
place
under
a
rock
and
marked
out
a
semicircle
for
my
encampment
which
i
resolved
to
strengthen
with
a
work
wall
or
fortification
made
of
double
piles
lined
within
with
cables
and
without
with
turf
from
the
th
to
the
th
i
worked
very
hard
in
carrying
all
my
goods
to
my
new
habitation
though
some
part
of
the
time
it
rained
exceedingly
hard
the
st
in
the
morning
i
went
out
into
the
island
with
my
gun
to
seek
for
some
food
and
discover
the
country
when
i
killed
a
she
goat
and
her
kid
followed
me
home
which
i
afterwards
killed
also
because
it
would
not
feed
november
i
set
up
my
tent
under
a
rock
and
lay
there
for
the
first
night
making
it
as
large
as
i
could
with
stakes
driven
in
to
swing
my
hammock
upon
nov
i
set
up
all
my
chests
and
boards
and
the
pieces
of
timber
which
made
my
rafts
and
with
them
formed
a
fence
round
me
a
little
within
the
place
i
had
marked
out
for
my
fortification
nov
i
went
out
with
my
gun
and
killed
two
fowls
like
ducks
which
were
very
good
food
in
the
afternoon
went
to
work
to
make
me
a
table
nov
this
morning
i
began
to
order
my
times
of
work
of
going
out
with
my
gun
time
of
sleep
and
time
of
diversion
viz
every
morning
i
walked
out
with
my
gun
for
two
or
three
hours
if
it
did
not
rain
then
employed
myself
to
work
till
about
eleven
o
clock
then
eat
what
i
had
to
live
on
and
from
twelve
to
two
i
lay
down
to
sleep
the
weather
being
excessively
hot
and
then
in
the
evening
to
work
again
the
working
part
of
this
day
and
of
the
next
were
wholly
employed
in
making
my
table
for
i
was
yet
but
a
very
sorry
workman
though
time
and
necessity
made
me
a
complete
natural
mechanic
soon
after
as
i
believe
they
would
do
any
one
else
nov
this
day
went
abroad
with
my
gun
and
my
dog
and
killed
a
wild
cat
her
skin
pretty
soft
but
her
flesh
good
for
nothing
every
creature
that
i
killed
i
took
of
the
skins
and
preserved
them
coming
back
by
the
sea
shore
i
saw
many
sorts
of
sea
fowls
which
i
did
not
understand
but
was
surprised
and
almost
frightened
with
two
or
three
seals
which
while
i
was
gazing
at
not
well
knowing
what
they
were
got
into
the
sea
and
escaped
me
for
that
time
nov
after
my
morning
walk
i
went
to
work
with
my
table
again
and
finished
it
though
not
to
my
liking
nor
was
it
long
before
i
learned
to
mend
it
nov
now
it
began
to
be
settled
fair
weather
the
th
th
th
th
and
part
of
the
th
for
the
th
was
sunday
i
took
wholly
up
to
make
me
a
chair
and
with
much
ado
brought
it
to
a
tolerable
shape
but
never
to
please
me
and
even
in
the
making
i
pulled
it
in
pieces
several
times
note
i
soon
neglected
my
keeping
sundays
for
omitting
my
mark
for
them
on
my
post
i
forgot
which
was
which
nov
this
day
it
rained
which
refreshed
me
exceedingly
and
cooled
the
earth
but
it
was
accompanied
with
terrible
thunder
and
lightning
which
frightened
me
dreadfully
for
fear
of
my
powder
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
resolved
to
separate
my
stock
of
powder
into
as
many
little
parcels
as
possible
that
it
might
not
be
in
danger
nov
these
three
days
i
spent
in
making
little
square
chests
or
boxes
which
might
hold
about
a
pound
or
two
pounds
at
most
of
powder
and
so
putting
the
powder
in
i
stowed
it
in
places
as
secure
and
remote
from
one
another
as
possible
on
one
of
these
three
days
i
killed
a
large
bird
that
was
good
to
eat
but
i
knew
not
what
to
call
it
nov
this
day
i
began
to
dig
behind
my
tent
into
the
rock
to
make
room
for
my
further
conveniency
note
three
things
i
wanted
exceedingly
for
this
work
viz
a
pickaxe
a
shovel
and
a
wheelbarrow
or
basket
so
i
desisted
from
my
work
and
began
to
consider
how
to
supply
that
want
and
make
me
some
tools
as
for
the
pickaxe
i
made
use
of
the
iron
crows
which
were
proper
enough
though
heavy
but
the
next
thing
was
a
shovel
or
spade
this
was
so
absolutely
necessary
that
indeed
i
could
do
nothing
effectually
without
it
but
what
kind
of
one
to
make
i
knew
not
nov
the
next
day
in
searching
the
woods
i
found
a
tree
of
that
wood
or
like
it
which
in
the
brazils
they
call
the
iron
tree
for
its
exceeding
hardness
of
this
with
great
labour
and
almost
spoiling
my
axe
i
cut
a
piece
and
brought
it
home
too
with
difficulty
enough
for
it
was
exceeding
heavy
the
excessive
hardness
of
the
wood
and
my
having
no
other
way
made
me
a
long
while
upon
this
machine
for
i
worked
it
effectually
by
little
and
little
into
the
form
of
a
shovel
or
spade
the
handle
exactly
shaped
like
ours
in
england
only
that
the
board
part
having
no
iron
shod
upon
it
at
bottom
it
would
not
last
me
so
long
however
it
served
well
enough
for
the
uses
which
i
had
occasion
to
put
it
to
but
never
was
a
shovel
i
believe
made
after
that
fashion
or
so
long
in
making
i
was
still
deficient
for
i
wanted
a
basket
or
a
wheelbarrow
a
basket
i
could
not
make
by
any
means
having
no
such
things
as
twigs
that
would
bend
to
make
wicker
ware
at
least
none
yet
found
out
and
as
to
a
wheelbarrow
i
fancied
i
could
make
all
but
the
wheel
but
that
i
had
no
notion
of
neither
did
i
know
how
to
go
about
it
besides
i
had
no
possible
way
to
make
the
iron
gudgeons
for
the
spindle
or
axis
of
the
wheel
to
run
in
so
i
gave
it
over
and
so
for
carrying
away
the
earth
which
i
dug
out
of
the
cave
i
made
me
a
thing
like
a
hod
which
the
labourers
carry
mortar
in
when
they
serve
the
bricklayers
this
was
not
so
difficult
to
me
as
the
making
the
shovel
and
yet
this
and
the
shovel
and
the
attempt
which
i
made
in
vain
to
make
a
wheelbarrow
took
me
up
no
less
than
four
days
i
mean
always
excepting
my
morning
walk
with
my
gun
which
i
seldom
failed
and
very
seldom
failed
also
bringing
home
something
fit
to
eat
nov
my
other
work
having
now
stood
still
because
of
my
making
these
tools
when
they
were
finished
i
went
on
and
working
every
day
as
my
strength
and
time
allowed
i
spent
eighteen
days
entirely
in
widening
and
deepening
my
cave
that
it
might
hold
my
goods
commodiously
note
during
all
this
time
i
worked
to
make
this
room
or
cave
spacious
enough
to
accommodate
me
as
a
warehouse
or
magazine
a
kitchen
a
dining
room
and
a
cellar
as
for
my
lodging
i
kept
to
the
tent
except
that
sometimes
in
the
wet
season
of
the
year
it
rained
so
hard
that
i
could
not
keep
myself
dry
which
caused
me
afterwards
to
cover
all
my
place
within
my
pale
with
long
poles
in
the
form
of
rafters
leaning
against
the
rock
and
load
them
with
flags
and
large
leaves
of
trees
like
a
thatch
december
i
began
now
to
think
my
cave
or
vault
finished
when
on
a
sudden
it
seems
i
had
made
it
too
large
a
great
quantity
of
earth
fell
down
from
the
top
on
one
side
so
much
that
in
short
it
frighted
me
and
not
without
reason
too
for
if
i
had
been
under
it
i
had
never
wanted
a
gravedigger
i
had
now
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
over
again
for
i
had
the
loose
earth
to
carry
out
and
which
was
of
more
importance
i
had
the
ceiling
to
prop
up
so
that
i
might
be
sure
no
more
would
come
down
dec
this
day
i
went
to
work
with
it
accordingly
and
got
two
shores
or
posts
pitched
upright
to
the
top
with
two
pieces
of
boards
across
over
each
post
this
i
finished
the
next
day
and
setting
more
posts
up
with
boards
in
about
a
week
more
i
had
the
roof
secured
and
the
posts
standing
in
rows
served
me
for
partitions
to
part
off
the
house
dec
from
this
day
to
the
th
i
placed
shelves
and
knocked
up
nails
on
the
posts
to
hang
everything
up
that
could
be
hung
up
and
now
i
began
to
be
in
some
order
within
doors
dec
now
i
carried
everything
into
the
cave
and
began
to
furnish
my
house
and
set
up
some
pieces
of
boards
like
a
dresser
to
order
my
victuals
upon
but
boards
began
to
be
very
scarce
with
me
also
i
made
me
another
table
dec
much
rain
all
night
and
all
day
no
stirring
out
dec
rain
all
day
dec
no
rain
and
the
earth
much
cooler
than
before
and
pleasanter
dec
killed
a
young
goat
and
lamed
another
so
that
i
caught
it
and
led
it
home
in
a
string
when
i
had
it
at
home
i
bound
and
splintered
up
its
leg
which
was
broke
n
b
i
took
such
care
of
it
that
it
lived
and
the
leg
grew
well
and
as
strong
as
ever
but
by
my
nursing
it
so
long
it
grew
tame
and
fed
upon
the
little
green
at
my
door
and
would
not
go
away
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
entertained
a
thought
of
breeding
up
some
tame
creatures
that
i
might
have
food
when
my
powder
and
shot
was
all
spent
dec
great
heats
and
no
breeze
so
that
there
was
no
stirring
abroad
except
in
the
evening
for
food
this
time
i
spent
in
putting
all
my
things
in
order
within
doors
january
very
hot
still
but
i
went
abroad
early
and
late
with
my
gun
and
lay
still
in
the
middle
of
the
day
this
evening
going
farther
into
the
valleys
which
lay
towards
the
centre
of
the
island
i
found
there
were
plenty
of
goats
though
exceedingly
shy
and
hard
to
come
at
however
i
resolved
to
try
if
i
could
not
bring
my
dog
to
hunt
them
down
jan
accordingly
the
next
day
i
went
out
with
my
dog
and
set
him
upon
the
goats
but
i
was
mistaken
for
they
all
faced
about
upon
the
dog
and
he
knew
his
danger
too
well
for
he
would
not
come
near
them
jan
i
began
my
fence
or
wall
which
being
still
jealous
of
my
being
attacked
by
somebody
i
resolved
to
make
very
thick
and
strong
n
b
this
wall
being
described
before
i
purposely
omit
what
was
said
in
the
journal
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
i
was
no
less
time
than
from
the
nd
of
january
to
the
th
of
april
working
finishing
and
perfecting
this
wall
though
it
was
no
more
than
about
twenty
four
yards
in
length
being
a
half
circle
from
one
place
in
the
rock
to
another
place
about
eight
yards
from
it
the
door
of
the
cave
being
in
the
centre
behind
it
all
this
time
i
worked
very
hard
the
rains
hindering
me
many
days
nay
sometimes
weeks
together
but
i
thought
i
should
never
be
perfectly
secure
till
this
wall
was
finished
and
it
is
scarce
credible
what
inexpressible
labour
everything
was
done
with
especially
the
bringing
piles
out
of
the
woods
and
driving
them
into
the
ground
for
i
made
them
much
bigger
than
i
needed
to
have
done
when
this
wall
was
finished
and
the
outside
double
fenced
with
a
turf
wall
raised
up
close
to
it
i
perceived
myself
that
if
any
people
were
to
come
on
shore
there
they
would
not
perceive
anything
like
a
habitation
and
it
was
very
well
i
did
so
as
may
be
observed
hereafter
upon
a
very
remarkable
occasion
during
this
time
i
made
my
rounds
in
the
woods
for
game
every
day
when
the
rain
permitted
me
and
made
frequent
discoveries
in
these
walks
of
something
or
other
to
my
advantage
particularly
i
found
a
kind
of
wild
pigeons
which
build
not
as
wood
pigeons
in
a
tree
but
rather
as
house
pigeons
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
taking
some
young
ones
i
endeavoured
to
breed
them
up
tame
and
did
so
but
when
they
grew
older
they
flew
away
which
perhaps
was
at
first
for
want
of
feeding
them
for
i
had
nothing
to
give
them
however
i
frequently
found
their
nests
and
got
their
young
ones
which
were
very
good
meat
and
now
in
the
managing
my
household
affairs
i
found
myself
wanting
in
many
things
which
i
thought
at
first
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
as
indeed
with
some
of
them
it
was
for
instance
i
could
never
make
a
cask
to
be
hooped
i
had
a
small
runlet
or
two
as
i
observed
before
but
i
could
never
arrive
at
the
capacity
of
making
one
by
them
though
i
spent
many
weeks
about
it
i
could
neither
put
in
the
heads
or
join
the
staves
so
true
to
one
another
as
to
make
them
hold
water
so
i
gave
that
also
over
in
the
next
place
i
was
at
a
great
loss
for
candles
so
that
as
soon
as
ever
it
was
dark
which
was
generally
by
seven
o
clock
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
i
remembered
the
lump
of
beeswax
with
which
i
made
candles
in
my
african
adventure
but
i
had
none
of
that
now
the
only
remedy
i
had
was
that
when
i
had
killed
a
goat
i
saved
the
tallow
and
with
a
little
dish
made
of
clay
which
i
baked
in
the
sun
to
which
i
added
a
wick
of
some
oakum
i
made
me
a
lamp
and
this
gave
me
light
though
not
a
clear
steady
light
like
a
candle
in
the
middle
of
all
my
labours
it
happened
that
rummaging
my
things
i
found
a
little
bag
which
as
i
hinted
before
had
been
filled
with
corn
for
the
feeding
of
poultry
not
for
this
voyage
but
before
as
i
suppose
when
the
ship
came
from
lisbon
the
little
remainder
of
corn
that
had
been
in
the
bag
was
all
devoured
by
the
rats
and
i
saw
nothing
in
the
bag
but
husks
and
dust
and
being
willing
to
have
the
bag
for
some
other
use
i
think
it
was
to
put
powder
in
when
i
divided
it
for
fear
of
the
lightning
or
some
such
use
i
shook
the
husks
of
corn
out
of
it
on
one
side
of
my
fortification
under
the
rock
it
was
a
little
before
the
great
rains
just
now
mentioned
that
i
threw
this
stuff
away
taking
no
notice
and
not
so
much
as
remembering
that
i
had
thrown
anything
there
when
about
a
month
after
or
thereabouts
i
saw
some
few
stalks
of
something
green
shooting
out
of
the
ground
which
i
fancied
might
be
some
plant
i
had
not
seen
but
i
was
surprised
and
perfectly
astonished
when
after
a
little
longer
time
i
saw
about
ten
or
twelve
ears
come
out
which
were
perfect
green
barley
of
the
same
kind
as
our
european
nay
as
our
english
barley
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
and
confusion
of
my
thoughts
on
this
occasion
i
had
hitherto
acted
upon
no
religious
foundation
at
all
indeed
i
had
very
few
notions
of
religion
in
my
head
nor
had
entertained
any
sense
of
anything
that
had
befallen
me
otherwise
than
as
chance
or
as
we
lightly
say
what
pleases
god
without
so
much
as
inquiring
into
the
end
of
providence
in
these
things
or
his
order
in
governing
events
for
the
world
but
after
i
saw
barley
grow
there
in
a
climate
which
i
knew
was
not
proper
for
corn
and
especially
that
i
knew
not
how
it
came
there
it
startled
me
strangely
and
i
began
to
suggest
that
god
had
miraculously
caused
his
grain
to
grow
without
any
help
of
seed
sown
and
that
it
was
so
directed
purely
for
my
sustenance
on
that
wild
miserable
place
this
touched
my
heart
a
little
and
brought
tears
out
of
my
eyes
and
i
began
to
bless
myself
that
such
a
prodigy
of
nature
should
happen
upon
my
account
and
this
was
the
more
strange
to
me
because
i
saw
near
it
still
all
along
by
the
side
of
the
rock
some
other
straggling
stalks
which
proved
to
be
stalks
of
rice
and
which
i
knew
because
i
had
seen
it
grow
in
africa
when
i
was
ashore
there
i
not
only
thought
these
the
pure
productions
of
providence
for
my
support
but
not
doubting
that
there
was
more
in
the
place
i
went
all
over
that
part
of
the
island
where
i
had
been
before
peering
in
every
corner
and
under
every
rock
to
see
for
more
of
it
but
i
could
not
find
any
at
last
it
occurred
to
my
thoughts
that
i
shook
a
bag
of
chickens
meat
out
in
that
place
and
then
the
wonder
began
to
cease
and
i
must
confess
my
religious
thankfulness
to
god
s
providence
began
to
abate
too
upon
the
discovering
that
all
this
was
nothing
but
what
was
common
though
i
ought
to
have
been
as
thankful
for
so
strange
and
unforeseen
a
providence
as
if
it
had
been
miraculous
for
it
was
really
the
work
of
providence
to
me
that
should
order
or
appoint
that
ten
or
twelve
grains
of
corn
should
remain
unspoiled
when
the
rats
had
destroyed
all
the
rest
as
if
it
had
been
dropped
from
heaven
as
also
that
i
should
throw
it
out
in
that
particular
place
where
it
being
in
the
shade
of
a
high
rock
it
sprang
up
immediately
whereas
if
i
had
thrown
it
anywhere
else
at
that
time
it
had
been
burnt
up
and
destroyed
i
carefully
saved
the
ears
of
this
corn
you
may
be
sure
in
their
season
which
was
about
the
end
of
june
and
laying
up
every
corn
i
resolved
to
sow
them
all
again
hoping
in
time
to
have
some
quantity
sufficient
to
supply
me
with
bread
but
it
was
not
till
the
fourth
year
that
i
could
allow
myself
the
least
grain
of
this
corn
to
eat
and
even
then
but
sparingly
as
i
shall
say
afterwards
in
its
order
for
i
lost
all
that
i
sowed
the
first
season
by
not
observing
the
proper
time
for
i
sowed
it
just
before
the
dry
season
so
that
it
never
came
up
at
all
at
least
not
as
it
would
have
done
of
which
in
its
place
besides
this
barley
there
were
as
above
twenty
or
thirty
stalks
of
rice
which
i
preserved
with
the
same
care
and
for
the
same
use
or
to
the
same
purpose
to
make
me
bread
or
rather
food
for
i
found
ways
to
cook
it
without
baking
though
i
did
that
also
after
some
time
but
to
return
to
my
journal
i
worked
excessive
hard
these
three
or
four
months
to
get
my
wall
done
and
the
th
of
april
i
closed
it
up
contriving
to
go
into
it
not
by
a
door
but
over
the
wall
by
a
ladder
that
there
might
be
no
sign
on
the
outside
of
my
habitation
april
i
finished
the
ladder
so
i
went
up
the
ladder
to
the
top
and
then
pulled
it
up
after
me
and
let
it
down
in
the
inside
this
was
a
complete
enclosure
to
me
for
within
i
had
room
enough
and
nothing
could
come
at
me
from
without
unless
it
could
first
mount
my
wall
the
very
next
day
after
this
wall
was
finished
i
had
almost
had
all
my
labour
overthrown
at
once
and
myself
killed
the
case
was
thus
as
i
was
busy
in
the
inside
behind
my
tent
just
at
the
entrance
into
my
cave
i
was
terribly
frighted
with
a
most
dreadful
surprising
thing
indeed
for
all
on
a
sudden
i
found
the
earth
come
crumbling
down
from
the
roof
of
my
cave
and
from
the
edge
of
the
hill
over
my
head
and
two
of
the
posts
i
had
set
up
in
the
cave
cracked
in
a
frightful
manner
i
was
heartily
scared
but
thought
nothing
of
what
was
really
the
cause
only
thinking
that
the
top
of
my
cave
was
fallen
in
as
some
of
it
had
done
before
and
for
fear
i
should
be
buried
in
it
i
ran
forward
to
my
ladder
and
not
thinking
myself
safe
there
neither
i
got
over
my
wall
for
fear
of
the
pieces
of
the
hill
which
i
expected
might
roll
down
upon
me
i
had
no
sooner
stepped
do
ground
than
i
plainly
saw
it
was
a
terrible
earthquake
for
the
ground
i
stood
on
shook
three
times
at
about
eight
minutes
distance
with
three
such
shocks
as
would
have
overturned
the
strongest
building
that
could
be
supposed
to
have
stood
on
the
earth
and
a
great
piece
of
the
top
of
a
rock
which
stood
about
half
a
mile
from
me
next
the
sea
fell
down
with
such
a
terrible
noise
as
i
never
heard
in
all
my
life
i
perceived
also
the
very
sea
was
put
into
violent
motion
by
it
and
i
believe
the
shocks
were
stronger
under
the
water
than
on
the
island
i
was
so
much
amazed
with
the
thing
itself
having
never
felt
the
like
nor
discoursed
with
any
one
that
had
that
i
was
like
one
dead
or
stupefied
and
the
motion
of
the
earth
made
my
stomach
sick
like
one
that
was
tossed
at
sea
but
the
noise
of
the
falling
of
the
rock
awakened
me
as
it
were
and
rousing
me
from
the
stupefied
condition
i
was
in
filled
me
with
horror
and
i
thought
of
nothing
then
but
the
hill
falling
upon
my
tent
and
all
my
household
goods
and
burying
all
at
once
and
this
sunk
my
very
soul
within
me
a
second
time
after
the
third
shock
was
over
and
i
felt
no
more
for
some
time
i
began
to
take
courage
and
yet
i
had
not
heart
enough
to
go
over
my
wall
again
for
fear
of
being
buried
alive
but
sat
still
upon
the
ground
greatly
cast
down
and
disconsolate
not
knowing
what
to
do
all
this
while
i
had
not
the
least
serious
religious
thought
nothing
but
the
common
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
and
when
it
was
over
that
went
away
too
while
i
sat
thus
i
found
the
air
overcast
and
grow
cloudy
as
if
it
would
rain
soon
after
that
the
wind
arose
by
little
and
little
so
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
it
blew
a
most
dreadful
hurricane
the
sea
was
all
on
a
sudden
covered
over
with
foam
and
froth
the
shore
was
covered
with
the
breach
of
the
water
the
trees
were
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
a
terrible
storm
it
was
this
held
about
three
hours
and
then
began
to
abate
and
in
two
hours
more
it
was
quite
calm
and
began
to
rain
very
hard
all
this
while
i
sat
upon
the
ground
very
much
terrified
and
dejected
when
on
a
sudden
it
came
into
my
thoughts
that
these
winds
and
rain
being
the
consequences
of
the
earthquake
the
earthquake
itself
was
spent
and
over
and
i
might
venture
into
my
cave
again
with
this
thought
my
spirits
began
to
revive
and
the
rain
also
helping
to
persuade
me
i
went
in
and
sat
down
in
my
tent
but
the
rain
was
so
violent
that
my
tent
was
ready
to
be
beaten
down
with
it
and
i
was
forced
to
go
into
my
cave
though
very
much
afraid
and
uneasy
for
fear
it
should
fall
on
my
head
this
violent
rain
forced
me
to
a
new
work
viz
to
cut
a
hole
through
my
new
fortification
like
a
sink
to
let
the
water
go
out
which
would
else
have
flooded
my
cave
after
i
had
been
in
my
cave
for
some
time
and
found
still
no
more
shocks
of
the
earthquake
follow
i
began
to
be
more
composed
and
now
to
support
my
spirits
which
indeed
wanted
it
very
much
i
went
to
my
little
store
and
took
a
small
sup
of
rum
which
however
i
did
then
and
always
very
sparingly
knowing
i
could
have
no
more
when
that
was
gone
it
continued
raining
all
that
night
and
great
part
of
the
next
day
so
that
i
could
not
stir
abroad
but
my
mind
being
more
composed
i
began
to
think
of
what
i
had
best
do
concluding
that
if
the
island
was
subject
to
these
earthquakes
there
would
be
no
living
for
me
in
a
cave
but
i
must
consider
of
building
a
little
hut
in
an
open
place
which
i
might
surround
with
a
wall
as
i
had
done
here
and
so
make
myself
secure
from
wild
beasts
or
men
for
i
concluded
if
i
stayed
where
i
was
i
should
certainly
one
time
or
other
be
buried
alive
with
these
thoughts
i
resolved
to
remove
my
tent
from
the
place
where
it
stood
which
was
just
under
the
hanging
precipice
of
the
hill
and
which
if
it
should
be
shaken
again
would
certainly
fall
upon
my
tent
and
i
spent
the
two
next
days
being
the
th
and
th
of
april
in
contriving
where
and
how
to
remove
my
habitation
the
fear
of
being
swallowed
up
alive
made
me
that
i
never
slept
in
quiet
and
yet
the
apprehension
of
lying
abroad
without
any
fence
was
almost
equal
to
it
but
still
when
i
looked
about
and
saw
how
everything
was
put
in
order
how
pleasantly
concealed
i
was
and
how
safe
from
danger
it
made
me
very
loath
to
remove
in
the
meantime
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
require
a
vast
deal
of
time
for
me
to
do
this
and
that
i
must
be
contented
to
venture
where
i
was
till
i
had
formed
a
camp
for
myself
and
had
secured
it
so
as
to
remove
to
it
so
with
this
resolution
i
composed
myself
for
a
time
and
resolved
that
i
would
go
to
work
with
all
speed
to
build
me
a
wall
with
piles
and
cables
c
in
a
circle
as
before
and
set
my
tent
up
in
it
when
it
was
finished
but
that
i
would
venture
to
stay
where
i
was
till
it
was
finished
and
fit
to
remove
this
was
the
st
april
the
next
morning
i
begin
to
consider
of
means
to
put
this
resolve
into
execution
but
i
was
at
a
great
loss
about
my
tools
i
had
three
large
axes
and
abundance
of
hatchets
for
we
carried
the
hatchets
for
traffic
with
the
indians
but
with
much
chopping
and
cutting
knotty
hard
wood
they
were
all
full
of
notches
and
dull
and
though
i
had
a
grindstone
i
could
not
turn
it
and
grind
my
tools
too
this
cost
me
as
much
thought
as
a
statesman
would
have
bestowed
upon
a
grand
point
of
politics
or
a
judge
upon
the
life
and
death
of
a
man
at
length
i
contrived
a
wheel
with
a
string
to
turn
it
with
my
foot
that
i
might
have
both
my
hands
at
liberty
note
i
had
never
seen
any
such
thing
in
england
or
at
least
not
to
take
notice
how
it
was
done
though
since
i
have
observed
it
is
very
common
there
besides
that
my
grindstone
was
very
large
and
heavy
this
machine
cost
me
a
full
week
s
work
to
bring
it
to
perfection
april
these
two
whole
days
i
took
up
in
grinding
my
tools
my
machine
for
turning
my
grindstone
performing
very
well
april
having
perceived
my
bread
had
been
low
a
great
while
now
i
took
a
survey
of
it
and
reduced
myself
to
one
biscuit
cake
a
day
which
made
my
heart
very
heavy
may
in
the
morning
looking
towards
the
sea
side
the
tide
being
low
i
saw
something
lie
on
the
shore
bigger
than
ordinary
and
it
looked
like
a
cask
when
i
came
to
it
i
found
a
small
barrel
and
two
or
three
pieces
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
which
were
driven
on
shore
by
the
late
hurricane
and
looking
towards
the
wreck
itself
i
thought
it
seemed
to
lie
higher
out
of
the
water
than
it
used
to
do
i
examined
the
barrel
which
was
driven
on
shore
and
soon
found
it
was
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
but
it
had
taken
water
and
the
powder
was
caked
as
hard
as
a
stone
however
i
rolled
it
farther
on
shore
for
the
present
and
went
on
upon
the
sands
as
near
as
i
could
to
the
wreck
of
the
ship
to
look
for
more

conscience
stricken
when
i
came
down
to
the
ship
i
found
it
strangely
removed
the
forecastle
which
lay
before
buried
in
sand
was
heaved
up
at
least
six
feet
and
the
stern
which
was
broke
in
pieces
and
parted
from
the
rest
by
the
force
of
the
sea
soon
after
i
had
left
rummaging
her
was
tossed
as
it
were
up
and
cast
on
one
side
and
the
sand
was
thrown
so
high
on
that
side
next
her
stern
that
whereas
there
was
a
great
place
of
water
before
so
that
i
could
not
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
wreck
without
swimming
i
could
now
walk
quite
up
to
her
when
the
tide
was
out
i
was
surprised
with
this
at
first
but
soon
concluded
it
must
be
done
by
the
earthquake
and
as
by
this
violence
the
ship
was
more
broke
open
than
formerly
so
many
things
came
daily
on
shore
which
the
sea
had
loosened
and
which
the
winds
and
water
rolled
by
degrees
to
the
land
this
wholly
diverted
my
thoughts
from
the
design
of
removing
my
habitation
and
i
busied
myself
mightily
that
day
especially
in
searching
whether
i
could
make
any
way
into
the
ship
but
i
found
nothing
was
to
be
expected
of
that
kind
for
all
the
inside
of
the
ship
was
choked
up
with
sand
however
as
i
had
learned
not
to
despair
of
anything
i
resolved
to
pull
everything
to
pieces
that
i
could
of
the
ship
concluding
that
everything
i
could
get
from
her
would
be
of
some
use
or
other
to
me
may
i
began
with
my
saw
and
cut
a
piece
of
a
beam
through
which
i
thought
held
some
of
the
upper
part
or
quarter
deck
together
and
when
i
had
cut
it
through
i
cleared
away
the
sand
as
well
as
i
could
from
the
side
which
lay
highest
but
the
tide
coming
in
i
was
obliged
to
give
over
for
that
time
may
i
went
a
fishing
but
caught
not
one
fish
that
i
durst
eat
of
till
i
was
weary
of
my
sport
when
just
going
to
leave
off
i
caught
a
young
dolphin
i
had
made
me
a
long
line
of
some
rope
yarn
but
i
had
no
hooks
yet
i
frequently
caught
fish
enough
as
much
as
i
cared
to
eat
all
which
i
dried
in
the
sun
and
ate
them
dry
may
worked
on
the
wreck
cut
another
beam
asunder
and
brought
three
great
fir
planks
off
from
the
decks
which
i
tied
together
and
made
to
float
on
shore
when
the
tide
of
flood
came
on
may
worked
on
the
wreck
got
several
iron
bolts
out
of
her
and
other
pieces
of
ironwork
worked
very
hard
and
came
home
very
much
tired
and
had
thoughts
of
giving
it
over
may
went
to
the
wreck
again
not
with
an
intent
to
work
but
found
the
weight
of
the
wreck
had
broke
itself
down
the
beams
being
cut
that
several
pieces
of
the
ship
seemed
to
lie
loose
and
the
inside
of
the
hold
lay
so
open
that
i
could
see
into
it
but
it
was
almost
full
of
water
and
sand
may
went
to
the
wreck
and
carried
an
iron
crow
to
wrench
up
the
deck
which
lay
now
quite
clear
of
the
water
or
sand
i
wrenched
open
two
planks
and
brought
them
on
shore
also
with
the
tide
i
left
the
iron
crow
in
the
wreck
for
next
day
may
went
to
the
wreck
and
with
the
crow
made
way
into
the
body
of
the
wreck
and
felt
several
casks
and
loosened
them
with
the
crow
but
could
not
break
them
up
i
felt
also
a
roll
of
english
lead
and
could
stir
it
but
it
was
too
heavy
to
remove
may
went
every
day
to
the
wreck
and
got
a
great
many
pieces
of
timber
and
boards
or
plank
and
two
or
three
hundredweight
of
iron
may
i
carried
two
hatchets
to
try
if
i
could
not
cut
a
piece
off
the
roll
of
lead
by
placing
the
edge
of
one
hatchet
and
driving
it
with
the
other
but
as
it
lay
about
a
foot
and
a
half
in
the
water
i
could
not
make
any
blow
to
drive
the
hatchet
may
it
had
blown
hard
in
the
night
and
the
wreck
appeared
more
broken
by
the
force
of
the
water
but
i
stayed
so
long
in
the
woods
to
get
pigeons
for
food
that
the
tide
prevented
my
going
to
the
wreck
that
day
may
i
saw
some
pieces
of
the
wreck
blown
on
shore
at
a
great
distance
near
two
miles
off
me
but
resolved
to
see
what
they
were
and
found
it
was
a
piece
of
the
head
but
too
heavy
for
me
to
bring
away
may
every
day
to
this
day
i
worked
on
the
wreck
and
with
hard
labour
i
loosened
some
things
so
much
with
the
crow
that
the
first
flowing
tide
several
casks
floated
out
and
two
of
the
seamen
s
chests
but
the
wind
blowing
from
the
shore
nothing
came
to
land
that
day
but
pieces
of
timber
and
a
hogshead
which
had
some
brazil
pork
in
it
but
the
salt
water
and
the
sand
had
spoiled
it
i
continued
this
work
every
day
to
the
th
of
june
except
the
time
necessary
to
get
food
which
i
always
appointed
during
this
part
of
my
employment
to
be
when
the
tide
was
up
that
i
might
be
ready
when
it
was
ebbed
out
and
by
this
time
i
had
got
timber
and
plank
and
ironwork
enough
to
have
built
a
good
boat
if
i
had
known
how
and
also
i
got
at
several
times
and
in
several
pieces
near
one
hundredweight
of
the
sheet
lead
june
going
down
to
the
seaside
i
found
a
large
tortoise
or
turtle
this
was
the
first
i
had
seen
which
it
seems
was
only
my
misfortune
not
any
defect
of
the
place
or
scarcity
for
had
i
happened
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
i
might
have
had
hundreds
of
them
every
day
as
i
found
afterwards
but
perhaps
had
paid
dear
enough
for
them
june
i
spent
in
cooking
the
turtle
i
found
in
her
three
score
eggs
and
her
flesh
was
to
me
at
that
time
the
most
savoury
and
pleasant
that
ever
i
tasted
in
my
life
having
had
no
flesh
but
of
goats
and
fowls
since
i
landed
in
this
horrid
place
june
rained
all
day
and
i
stayed
within
i
thought
at
this
time
the
rain
felt
cold
and
i
was
something
chilly
which
i
knew
was
not
usual
in
that
latitude
june
very
ill
and
shivering
as
if
the
weather
had
been
cold
june
no
rest
all
night
violent
pains
in
my
head
and
feverish
june
very
ill
frighted
almost
to
death
with
the
apprehensions
of
my
sad
condition
to
be
sick
and
no
help
prayed
to
god
for
the
first
time
since
the
storm
off
hull
but
scarce
knew
what
i
said
or
why
my
thoughts
being
all
confused
june
a
little
better
but
under
dreadful
apprehensions
of
sickness
june
very
bad
again
cold
and
shivering
and
then
a
violent
headache
june
much
better
june
an
ague
very
violent
the
fit
held
me
seven
hours
cold
fit
and
hot
with
faint
sweats
after
it
june
better
and
having
no
victuals
to
eat
took
my
gun
but
found
myself
very
weak
however
i
killed
a
she
goat
and
with
much
difficulty
got
it
home
and
broiled
some
of
it
and
ate
i
would
fain
have
stewed
it
and
made
some
broth
but
had
no
pot
june
the
ague
again
so
violent
that
i
lay
a
bed
all
day
and
neither
ate
nor
drank
i
was
ready
to
perish
for
thirst
but
so
weak
i
had
not
strength
to
stand
up
or
to
get
myself
any
water
to
drink
prayed
to
god
again
but
was
light
headed
and
when
i
was
not
i
was
so
ignorant
that
i
knew
not
what
to
say
only
i
lay
and
cried
lord
look
upon
me
lord
pity
me
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
i
suppose
i
did
nothing
else
for
two
or
three
hours
till
the
fit
wearing
off
i
fell
asleep
and
did
not
wake
till
far
in
the
night
when
i
awoke
i
found
myself
much
refreshed
but
weak
and
exceeding
thirsty
however
as
i
had
no
water
in
my
habitation
i
was
forced
to
lie
till
morning
and
went
to
sleep
again
in
this
second
sleep
i
had
this
terrible
dream
i
thought
that
i
was
sitting
on
the
ground
on
the
outside
of
my
wall
where
i
sat
when
the
storm
blew
after
the
earthquake
and
that
i
saw
a
man
descend
from
a
great
black
cloud
in
a
bright
flame
of
fire
and
light
upon
the
ground
he
was
all
over
as
bright
as
a
flame
so
that
i
could
but
just
bear
to
look
towards
him
his
countenance
was
most
inexpressibly
dreadful
impossible
for
words
to
describe
when
he
stepped
upon
the
ground
with
his
feet
i
thought
the
earth
trembled
just
as
it
had
done
before
in
the
earthquake
and
all
the
air
looked
to
my
apprehension
as
if
it
had
been
filled
with
flashes
of
fire
he
was
no
sooner
landed
upon
the
earth
but
he
moved
forward
towards
me
with
a
long
spear
or
weapon
in
his
hand
to
kill
me
and
when
he
came
to
a
rising
ground
at
some
distance
he
spoke
to
me
or
i
heard
a
voice
so
terrible
that
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
terror
of
it
all
that
i
can
say
i
understood
was
this
seeing
all
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
to
repentance
now
thou
shalt
die
at
which
words
i
thought
he
lifted
up
the
spear
that
was
in
his
hand
to
kill
me
no
one
that
shall
ever
read
this
account
will
expect
that
i
should
be
able
to
describe
the
horrors
of
my
soul
at
this
terrible
vision
i
mean
that
even
while
it
was
a
dream
i
even
dreamed
of
those
horrors
nor
is
it
any
more
possible
to
describe
the
impression
that
remained
upon
my
mind
when
i
awaked
and
found
it
was
but
a
dream
i
had
alas
no
divine
knowledge
what
i
had
received
by
the
good
instruction
of
my
father
was
then
worn
out
by
an
uninterrupted
series
for
eight
years
of
seafaring
wickedness
and
a
constant
conversation
with
none
but
such
as
were
like
myself
wicked
and
profane
to
the
last
degree
i
do
not
remember
that
i
had
in
all
that
time
one
thought
that
so
much
as
tended
either
to
looking
upwards
towards
god
or
inwards
towards
a
reflection
upon
my
own
ways
but
a
certain
stupidity
of
soul
without
desire
of
good
or
conscience
of
evil
had
entirely
overwhelmed
me
and
i
was
all
that
the
most
hardened
unthinking
wicked
creature
among
our
common
sailors
can
be
supposed
to
be
not
having
the
least
sense
either
of
the
fear
of
god
in
danger
or
of
thankfulness
to
god
in
deliverance
in
the
relating
what
is
already
past
of
my
story
this
will
be
the
more
easily
believed
when
i
shall
add
that
through
all
the
variety
of
miseries
that
had
to
this
day
befallen
me
i
never
had
so
much
as
one
thought
of
it
being
the
hand
of
god
or
that
it
was
a
just
punishment
for
my
sin
my
rebellious
behaviour
against
my
father
or
my
present
sins
which
were
great
or
so
much
as
a
punishment
for
the
general
course
of
my
wicked
life
when
i
was
on
the
desperate
expedition
on
the
desert
shores
of
africa
i
never
had
so
much
as
one
thought
of
what
would
become
of
me
or
one
wish
to
god
to
direct
me
whither
i
should
go
or
to
keep
me
from
the
danger
which
apparently
surrounded
me
as
well
from
voracious
creatures
as
cruel
savages
but
i
was
merely
thoughtless
of
a
god
or
a
providence
acted
like
a
mere
brute
from
the
principles
of
nature
and
by
the
dictates
of
common
sense
only
and
indeed
hardly
that
when
i
was
delivered
and
taken
up
at
sea
by
the
portugal
captain
well
used
and
dealt
justly
and
honourably
with
as
well
as
charitably
i
had
not
the
least
thankfulness
in
my
thoughts
when
again
i
was
shipwrecked
ruined
and
in
danger
of
drowning
on
this
island
i
was
as
far
from
remorse
or
looking
on
it
as
a
judgment
i
only
said
to
myself
often
that
i
was
an
unfortunate
dog
and
born
to
be
always
miserable
it
is
true
when
i
got
on
shore
first
here
and
found
all
my
ship
s
crew
drowned
and
myself
spared
i
was
surprised
with
a
kind
of
ecstasy
and
some
transports
of
soul
which
had
the
grace
of
god
assisted
might
have
come
up
to
true
thankfulness
but
it
ended
where
it
began
in
a
mere
common
flight
of
joy
or
as
i
may
say
being
glad
i
was
alive
without
the
least
reflection
upon
the
distinguished
goodness
of
the
hand
which
had
preserved
me
and
had
singled
me
out
to
be
preserved
when
all
the
rest
were
destroyed
or
an
inquiry
why
providence
had
been
thus
merciful
unto
me
even
just
the
same
common
sort
of
joy
which
seamen
generally
have
after
they
are
got
safe
ashore
from
a
shipwreck
which
they
drown
all
in
the
next
bowl
of
punch
and
forget
almost
as
soon
as
it
is
over
and
all
the
rest
of
my
life
was
like
it
even
when
i
was
afterwards
on
due
consideration
made
sensible
of
my
condition
how
i
was
cast
on
this
dreadful
place
out
of
the
reach
of
human
kind
out
of
all
hope
of
relief
or
prospect
of
redemption
as
soon
as
i
saw
but
a
prospect
of
living
and
that
i
should
not
starve
and
perish
for
hunger
all
the
sense
of
my
affliction
wore
off
and
i
began
to
be
very
easy
applied
myself
to
the
works
proper
for
my
preservation
and
supply
and
was
far
enough
from
being
afflicted
at
my
condition
as
a
judgment
from
heaven
or
as
the
hand
of
god
against
me
these
were
thoughts
which
very
seldom
entered
my
head
the
growing
up
of
the
corn
as
is
hinted
in
my
journal
had
at
first
some
little
influence
upon
me
and
began
to
affect
me
with
seriousness
as
long
as
i
thought
it
had
something
miraculous
in
it
but
as
soon
as
ever
that
part
of
the
thought
was
removed
all
the
impression
that
was
raised
from
it
wore
off
also
as
i
have
noted
already
even
the
earthquake
though
nothing
could
be
more
terrible
in
its
nature
or
more
immediately
directing
to
the
invisible
power
which
alone
directs
such
things
yet
no
sooner
was
the
first
fright
over
but
the
impression
it
had
made
went
off
also
i
had
no
more
sense
of
god
or
his
judgments
much
less
of
the
present
affliction
of
my
circumstances
being
from
his
hand
than
if
i
had
been
in
the
most
prosperous
condition
of
life
but
now
when
i
began
to
be
sick
and
a
leisurely
view
of
the
miseries
of
death
came
to
place
itself
before
me
when
my
spirits
began
to
sink
under
the
burden
of
a
strong
distemper
and
nature
was
exhausted
with
the
violence
of
the
fever
conscience
that
had
slept
so
long
began
to
awake
and
i
began
to
reproach
myself
with
my
past
life
in
which
i
had
so
evidently
by
uncommon
wickedness
provoked
the
justice
of
god
to
lay
me
under
uncommon
strokes
and
to
deal
with
me
in
so
vindictive
a
manner
these
reflections
oppressed
me
for
the
second
or
third
day
of
my
distemper
and
in
the
violence
as
well
of
the
fever
as
of
the
dreadful
reproaches
of
my
conscience
extorted
some
words
from
me
like
praying
to
god
though
i
cannot
say
they
were
either
a
prayer
attended
with
desires
or
with
hopes
it
was
rather
the
voice
of
mere
fright
and
distress
my
thoughts
were
confused
the
convictions
great
upon
my
mind
and
the
horror
of
dying
in
such
a
miserable
condition
raised
vapours
into
my
head
with
the
mere
apprehensions
and
in
these
hurries
of
my
soul
i
knew
not
what
my
tongue
might
express
but
it
was
rather
exclamation
such
as
lord
what
a
miserable
creature
am
i
if
i
should
be
sick
i
shall
certainly
die
for
want
of
help
and
what
will
become
of
me
then
the
tears
burst
out
of
my
eyes
and
i
could
say
no
more
for
a
good
while
in
this
interval
the
good
advice
of
my
father
came
to
my
mind
and
presently
his
prediction
which
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
viz
that
if
i
did
take
this
foolish
step
god
would
not
bless
me
and
i
would
have
leisure
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
there
might
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
now
said
i
aloud
my
dear
father
s
words
are
come
to
pass
god
s
justice
has
overtaken
me
and
i
have
none
to
help
or
hear
me
i
rejected
the
voice
of
providence
which
had
mercifully
put
me
in
a
posture
or
station
of
life
wherein
i
might
have
been
happy
and
easy
but
i
would
neither
see
it
myself
nor
learn
to
know
the
blessing
of
it
from
my
parents
i
left
them
to
mourn
over
my
folly
and
now
i
am
left
to
mourn
under
the
consequences
of
it
i
abused
their
help
and
assistance
who
would
have
lifted
me
in
the
world
and
would
have
made
everything
easy
to
me
and
now
i
have
difficulties
to
struggle
with
too
great
for
even
nature
itself
to
support
and
no
assistance
no
help
no
comfort
no
advice
then
i
cried
out
lord
be
my
help
for
i
am
in
great
distress
this
was
the
first
prayer
if
i
may
call
it
so
that
i
had
made
for
many
years
but
to
return
to
my
journal
june
having
been
somewhat
refreshed
with
the
sleep
i
had
had
and
the
fit
being
entirely
off
i
got
up
and
though
the
fright
and
terror
of
my
dream
was
very
great
yet
i
considered
that
the
fit
of
the
ague
would
return
again
the
next
day
and
now
was
my
time
to
get
something
to
refresh
and
support
myself
when
i
should
be
ill
and
the
first
thing
i
did
i
filled
a
large
square
case
bottle
with
water
and
set
it
upon
my
table
in
reach
of
my
bed
and
to
take
off
the
chill
or
aguish
disposition
of
the
water
i
put
about
a
quarter
of
a
pint
of
rum
into
it
and
mixed
them
together
then
i
got
me
a
piece
of
the
goat
s
flesh
and
broiled
it
on
the
coals
but
could
eat
very
little
i
walked
about
but
was
very
weak
and
withal
very
sad
and
heavy
hearted
under
a
sense
of
my
miserable
condition
dreading
the
return
of
my
distemper
the
next
day
at
night
i
made
my
supper
of
three
of
the
turtle
s
eggs
which
i
roasted
in
the
ashes
and
ate
as
we
call
it
in
the
shell
and
this
was
the
first
bit
of
meat
i
had
ever
asked
god
s
blessing
to
that
i
could
remember
in
my
whole
life
after
i
had
eaten
i
tried
to
walk
but
found
myself
so
weak
that
i
could
hardly
carry
a
gun
for
i
never
went
out
without
that
so
i
went
but
a
little
way
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
looking
out
upon
the
sea
which
was
just
before
me
and
very
calm
and
smooth
as
i
sat
here
some
such
thoughts
as
these
occurred
to
me
what
is
this
earth
and
sea
of
which
i
have
seen
so
much
whence
is
it
produced
and
what
am
i
and
all
the
other
creatures
wild
and
tame
human
and
brutal
whence
are
we
sure
we
are
all
made
by
some
secret
power
who
formed
the
earth
and
sea
the
air
and
sky
and
who
is
that
then
it
followed
most
naturally
it
is
god
that
has
made
all
well
but
then
it
came
on
strangely
if
god
has
made
all
these
things
he
guides
and
governs
them
all
and
all
things
that
concern
them
for
the
power
that
could
make
all
things
must
certainly
have
power
to
guide
and
direct
them
if
so
nothing
can
happen
in
the
great
circuit
of
his
works
either
without
his
knowledge
or
appointment
and
if
nothing
happens
without
his
knowledge
he
knows
that
i
am
here
and
am
in
this
dreadful
condition
and
if
nothing
happens
without
his
appointment
he
has
appointed
all
this
to
befall
me
nothing
occurred
to
my
thought
to
contradict
any
of
these
conclusions
and
therefore
it
rested
upon
me
with
the
greater
force
that
it
must
needs
be
that
god
had
appointed
all
this
to
befall
me
that
i
was
brought
into
this
miserable
circumstance
by
his
direction
he
having
the
sole
power
not
of
me
only
but
of
everything
that
happened
in
the
world
immediately
it
followed
why
has
god
done
this
to
me
what
have
i
done
to
be
thus
used
my
conscience
presently
checked
me
in
that
inquiry
as
if
i
had
blasphemed
and
methought
it
spoke
to
me
like
a
voice
wretch
dost
thou
ask
what
thou
hast
done
look
back
upon
a
dreadful
misspent
life
and
ask
thyself
what
thou
hast
not
done
ask
why
is
it
that
thou
wert
not
long
ago
destroyed
why
wert
thou
not
drowned
in
yarmouth
roads
killed
in
the
fight
when
the
ship
was
taken
by
the
sallee
man
of
war
devoured
by
the
wild
beasts
on
the
coast
of
africa
or
drowned
here
when
all
the
crew
perished
but
thyself
dost
thou
ask
what
have
i
done
i
was
struck
dumb
with
these
reflections
as
one
astonished
and
had
not
a
word
to
say
no
not
to
answer
to
myself
but
rose
up
pensive
and
sad
walked
back
to
my
retreat
and
went
up
over
my
wall
as
if
i
had
been
going
to
bed
but
my
thoughts
were
sadly
disturbed
and
i
had
no
inclination
to
sleep
so
i
sat
down
in
my
chair
and
lighted
my
lamp
for
it
began
to
be
dark
now
as
the
apprehension
of
the
return
of
my
distemper
terrified
me
very
much
it
occurred
to
my
thought
that
the
brazilians
take
no
physic
but
their
tobacco
for
almost
all
distempers
and
i
had
a
piece
of
a
roll
of
tobacco
in
one
of
the
chests
which
was
quite
cured
and
some
also
that
was
green
and
not
quite
cured
i
went
directed
by
heaven
no
doubt
for
in
this
chest
i
found
a
cure
both
for
soul
and
body
i
opened
the
chest
and
found
what
i
looked
for
the
tobacco
and
as
the
few
books
i
had
saved
lay
there
too
i
took
out
one
of
the
bibles
which
i
mentioned
before
and
which
to
this
time
i
had
not
found
leisure
or
inclination
to
look
into
i
say
i
took
it
out
and
brought
both
that
and
the
tobacco
with
me
to
the
table
what
use
to
make
of
the
tobacco
i
knew
not
in
my
distemper
or
whether
it
was
good
for
it
or
no
but
i
tried
several
experiments
with
it
as
if
i
was
resolved
it
should
hit
one
way
or
other
i
first
took
a
piece
of
leaf
and
chewed
it
in
my
mouth
which
indeed
at
first
almost
stupefied
my
brain
the
tobacco
being
green
and
strong
and
that
i
had
not
been
much
used
to
then
i
took
some
and
steeped
it
an
hour
or
two
in
some
rum
and
resolved
to
take
a
dose
of
it
when
i
lay
down
and
lastly
i
burnt
some
upon
a
pan
of
coals
and
held
my
nose
close
over
the
smoke
of
it
as
long
as
i
could
bear
it
as
well
for
the
heat
as
almost
for
suffocation
in
the
interval
of
this
operation
i
took
up
the
bible
and
began
to
read
but
my
head
was
too
much
disturbed
with
the
tobacco
to
bear
reading
at
least
at
that
time
only
having
opened
the
book
casually
the
first
words
that
occurred
to
me
were
these
call
on
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
these
words
were
very
apt
to
my
case
and
made
some
impression
upon
my
thoughts
at
the
time
of
reading
them
though
not
so
much
as
they
did
afterwards
for
as
for
being
delivered
the
word
had
no
sound
as
i
may
say
to
me
the
thing
was
so
remote
so
impossible
in
my
apprehension
of
things
that
i
began
to
say
as
the
children
of
israel
did
when
they
were
promised
flesh
to
eat
can
god
spread
a
table
in
the
wilderness
so
i
began
to
say
can
god
himself
deliver
me
from
this
place
and
as
it
was
not
for
many
years
that
any
hopes
appeared
this
prevailed
very
often
upon
my
thoughts
but
however
the
words
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
and
i
mused
upon
them
very
often
it
grew
now
late
and
the
tobacco
had
as
i
said
dozed
my
head
so
much
that
i
inclined
to
sleep
so
i
left
my
lamp
burning
in
the
cave
lest
i
should
want
anything
in
the
night
and
went
to
bed
but
before
i
lay
down
i
did
what
i
never
had
done
in
all
my
life
i
kneeled
down
and
prayed
to
god
to
fulfil
the
promise
to
me
that
if
i
called
upon
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
he
would
deliver
me
after
my
broken
and
imperfect
prayer
was
over
i
drank
the
rum
in
which
i
had
steeped
the
tobacco
which
was
so
strong
and
rank
of
the
tobacco
that
i
could
scarcely
get
it
down
immediately
upon
this
i
went
to
bed
i
found
presently
it
flew
up
into
my
head
violently
but
i
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
and
waked
no
more
till
by
the
sun
it
must
necessarily
be
near
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
next
day
nay
to
this
hour
i
am
partly
of
opinion
that
i
slept
all
the
next
day
and
night
and
till
almost
three
the
day
after
for
otherwise
i
know
not
how
i
should
lose
a
day
out
of
my
reckoning
in
the
days
of
the
week
as
it
appeared
some
years
after
i
had
done
for
if
i
had
lost
it
by
crossing
and
recrossing
the
line
i
should
have
lost
more
than
one
day
but
certainly
i
lost
a
day
in
my
account
and
never
knew
which
way
be
that
however
one
way
or
the
other
when
i
awaked
i
found
myself
exceedingly
refreshed
and
my
spirits
lively
and
cheerful
when
i
got
up
i
was
stronger
than
i
was
the
day
before
and
my
stomach
better
for
i
was
hungry
and
in
short
i
had
no
fit
the
next
day
but
continued
much
altered
for
the
better
this
was
the
th
the
th
was
my
well
day
of
course
and
i
went
abroad
with
my
gun
but
did
not
care
to
travel
too
far
i
killed
a
sea
fowl
or
two
something
like
a
brandgoose
and
brought
them
home
but
was
not
very
forward
to
eat
them
so
i
ate
some
more
of
the
turtle
s
eggs
which
were
very
good
this
evening
i
renewed
the
medicine
which
i
had
supposed
did
me
good
the
day
before
the
tobacco
steeped
in
rum
only
i
did
not
take
so
much
as
before
nor
did
i
chew
any
of
the
leaf
or
hold
my
head
over
the
smoke
however
i
was
not
so
well
the
next
day
which
was
the
first
of
july
as
i
hoped
i
should
have
been
for
i
had
a
little
spice
of
the
cold
fit
but
it
was
not
much
july
i
renewed
the
medicine
all
the
three
ways
and
dosed
myself
with
it
as
at
first
and
doubled
the
quantity
which
i
drank
july
i
missed
the
fit
for
good
and
all
though
i
did
not
recover
my
full
strength
for
some
weeks
after
while
i
was
thus
gathering
strength
my
thoughts
ran
exceedingly
upon
this
scripture
i
will
deliver
thee
and
the
impossibility
of
my
deliverance
lay
much
upon
my
mind
in
bar
of
my
ever
expecting
it
but
as
i
was
discouraging
myself
with
such
thoughts
it
occurred
to
my
mind
that
i
pored
so
much
upon
my
deliverance
from
the
main
affliction
that
i
disregarded
the
deliverance
i
had
received
and
i
was
as
it
were
made
to
ask
myself
such
questions
as
these
viz
have
i
not
been
delivered
and
wonderfully
too
from
sickness
from
the
most
distressed
condition
that
could
be
and
that
was
so
frightful
to
me
and
what
notice
had
i
taken
of
it
had
i
done
my
part
god
had
delivered
me
but
i
had
not
glorified
him
that
is
to
say
i
had
not
owned
and
been
thankful
for
that
as
a
deliverance
and
how
could
i
expect
greater
deliverance
this
touched
my
heart
very
much
and
immediately
i
knelt
down
and
gave
god
thanks
aloud
for
my
recovery
from
my
sickness
july
in
the
morning
i
took
the
bible
and
beginning
at
the
new
testament
i
began
seriously
to
read
it
and
imposed
upon
myself
to
read
a
while
every
morning
and
every
night
not
tying
myself
to
the
number
of
chapters
but
long
as
my
thoughts
should
engage
me
it
was
not
long
after
i
set
seriously
to
this
work
till
i
found
my
heart
more
deeply
and
sincerely
affected
with
the
wickedness
of
my
past
life
the
impression
of
my
dream
revived
and
the
words
all
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
to
repentance
ran
seriously
through
my
thoughts
i
was
earnestly
begging
of
god
to
give
me
repentance
when
it
happened
providentially
the
very
day
that
reading
the
scripture
i
came
to
these
words
he
is
exalted
a
prince
and
a
saviour
to
give
repentance
and
to
give
remission
i
threw
down
the
book
and
with
my
heart
as
well
as
my
hands
lifted
up
to
heaven
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
of
joy
i
cried
out
aloud
jesus
thou
son
of
david
jesus
thou
exalted
prince
and
saviour
give
me
repentance
this
was
the
first
time
i
could
say
in
the
true
sense
of
the
words
that
i
prayed
in
all
my
life
for
now
i
prayed
with
a
sense
of
my
condition
and
a
true
scripture
view
of
hope
founded
on
the
encouragement
of
the
word
of
god
and
from
this
time
i
may
say
i
began
to
hope
that
god
would
hear
me
now
i
began
to
construe
the
words
mentioned
above
call
on
me
and
i
will
deliver
thee
in
a
different
sense
from
what
i
had
ever
done
before
for
then
i
had
no
notion
of
anything
being
called
deliverance
but
my
being
delivered
from
the
captivity
i
was
in
for
though
i
was
indeed
at
large
in
the
place
yet
the
island
was
certainly
a
prison
to
me
and
that
in
the
worse
sense
in
the
world
but
now
i
learned
to
take
it
in
another
sense
now
i
looked
back
upon
my
past
life
with
such
horror
and
my
sins
appeared
so
dreadful
that
my
soul
sought
nothing
of
god
but
deliverance
from
the
load
of
guilt
that
bore
down
all
my
comfort
as
for
my
solitary
life
it
was
nothing
i
did
not
so
much
as
pray
to
be
delivered
from
it
or
think
of
it
it
was
all
of
no
consideration
in
comparison
to
this
and
i
add
this
part
here
to
hint
to
whoever
shall
read
it
that
whenever
they
come
to
a
true
sense
of
things
they
will
find
deliverance
from
sin
a
much
greater
blessing
than
deliverance
from
affliction
but
leaving
this
part
i
return
to
my
journal
my
condition
began
now
to
be
though
not
less
miserable
as
to
my
way
of
living
yet
much
easier
to
my
mind
and
my
thoughts
being
directed
by
a
constant
reading
the
scripture
and
praying
to
god
to
things
of
a
higher
nature
i
had
a
great
deal
of
comfort
within
which
till
now
i
knew
nothing
of
also
my
health
and
strength
returned
i
bestirred
myself
to
furnish
myself
with
everything
that
i
wanted
and
make
my
way
of
living
as
regular
as
i
could
from
the
th
of
july
to
the
th
i
was
chiefly
employed
in
walking
about
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
a
little
and
a
little
at
a
time
as
a
man
that
was
gathering
up
his
strength
after
a
fit
of
sickness
for
it
is
hardly
to
be
imagined
how
low
i
was
and
to
what
weakness
i
was
reduced
the
application
which
i
made
use
of
was
perfectly
new
and
perhaps
which
had
never
cured
an
ague
before
neither
can
i
recommend
it
to
any
to
practise
by
this
experiment
and
though
it
did
carry
off
the
fit
yet
it
rather
contributed
to
weakening
me
for
i
had
frequent
convulsions
in
my
nerves
and
limbs
for
some
time
i
learned
from
it
also
this
in
particular
that
being
abroad
in
the
rainy
season
was
the
most
pernicious
thing
to
my
health
that
could
be
especially
in
those
rains
which
came
attended
with
storms
and
hurricanes
of
wind
for
as
the
rain
which
came
in
the
dry
season
was
almost
always
accompanied
with
such
storms
so
i
found
that
rain
was
much
more
dangerous
than
the
rain
which
fell
in
september
and
october
chapter
vii
agricultural
experience
i
had
now
been
in
this
unhappy
island
above
ten
months
all
possibility
of
deliverance
from
this
condition
seemed
to
be
entirely
taken
from
me
and
i
firmly
believe
that
no
human
shape
had
ever
set
foot
upon
that
place
having
now
secured
my
habitation
as
i
thought
fully
to
my
mind
i
had
a
great
desire
to
make
a
more
perfect
discovery
of
the
island
and
to
see
what
other
productions
i
might
find
which
i
yet
knew
nothing
of
it
was
on
the
th
of
july
that
i
began
to
take
a
more
particular
survey
of
the
island
itself
i
went
up
the
creek
first
where
as
i
hinted
i
brought
my
rafts
on
shore
i
found
after
i
came
about
two
miles
up
that
the
tide
did
not
flow
any
higher
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
little
brook
of
running
water
very
fresh
and
good
but
this
being
the
dry
season
there
was
hardly
any
water
in
some
parts
of
it
at
least
not
enough
to
run
in
any
stream
so
as
it
could
be
perceived
on
the
banks
of
this
brook
i
found
many
pleasant
savannahs
or
meadows
plain
smooth
and
covered
with
grass
and
on
the
rising
parts
of
them
next
to
the
higher
grounds
where
the
water
as
might
be
supposed
never
overflowed
i
found
a
great
deal
of
tobacco
green
and
growing
to
a
great
and
very
strong
stalk
there
were
divers
other
plants
which
i
had
no
notion
of
or
understanding
about
that
might
perhaps
have
virtues
of
their
own
which
i
could
not
find
out
i
searched
for
the
cassava
root
which
the
indians
in
all
that
climate
make
their
bread
of
but
i
could
find
none
i
saw
large
plants
of
aloes
but
did
not
understand
them
i
saw
several
sugar
canes
but
wild
and
for
want
of
cultivation
imperfect
i
contented
myself
with
these
discoveries
for
this
time
and
came
back
musing
with
myself
what
course
i
might
take
to
know
the
virtue
and
goodness
of
any
of
the
fruits
or
plants
which
i
should
discover
but
could
bring
it
to
no
conclusion
for
in
short
i
had
made
so
little
observation
while
i
was
in
the
brazils
that
i
knew
little
of
the
plants
in
the
field
at
least
very
little
that
might
serve
to
any
purpose
now
in
my
distress
the
next
day
the
sixteenth
i
went
up
the
same
way
again
and
after
going
something
further
than
i
had
gone
the
day
before
i
found
the
brook
and
the
savannahs
cease
and
the
country
become
more
woody
than
before
in
this
part
i
found
different
fruits
and
particularly
i
found
melons
upon
the
ground
in
great
abundance
and
grapes
upon
the
trees
the
vines
had
spread
indeed
over
the
trees
and
the
clusters
of
grapes
were
just
now
in
their
prime
very
ripe
and
rich
this
was
a
surprising
discovery
and
i
was
exceeding
glad
of
them
but
i
was
warned
by
my
experience
to
eat
sparingly
of
them
remembering
that
when
i
was
ashore
in
barbary
the
eating
of
grapes
killed
several
of
our
englishmen
who
were
slaves
there
by
throwing
them
into
fluxes
and
fevers
but
i
found
an
excellent
use
for
these
grapes
and
that
was
to
cure
or
dry
them
in
the
sun
and
keep
them
as
dried
grapes
or
raisins
are
kept
which
i
thought
would
be
as
indeed
they
were
wholesome
and
agreeable
to
eat
when
no
grapes
could
be
had
i
spent
all
that
evening
there
and
went
not
back
to
my
habitation
which
by
the
way
was
the
first
night
as
i
might
say
i
had
lain
from
home
in
the
night
i
took
my
first
contrivance
and
got
up
in
a
tree
where
i
slept
well
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
upon
my
discovery
travelling
nearly
four
miles
as
i
might
judge
by
the
length
of
the
valley
keeping
still
due
north
with
a
ridge
of
hills
on
the
south
and
north
side
of
me
at
the
end
of
this
march
i
came
to
an
opening
where
the
country
seemed
to
descend
to
the
west
and
a
little
spring
of
fresh
water
which
issued
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
by
me
ran
the
other
way
that
is
due
east
and
the
country
appeared
so
fresh
so
green
so
flourishing
everything
being
in
a
constant
verdure
or
flourish
of
spring
that
it
looked
like
a
planted
garden
i
descended
a
little
on
the
side
of
that
delicious
vale
surveying
it
with
a
secret
kind
of
pleasure
though
mixed
with
my
other
afflicting
thoughts
to
think
that
this
was
all
my
own
that
i
was
king
and
lord
of
all
this
country
indefensibly
and
had
a
right
of
possession
and
if
i
could
convey
it
i
might
have
it
in
inheritance
as
completely
as
any
lord
of
a
manor
in
england
i
saw
here
abundance
of
cocoa
trees
orange
and
lemon
and
citron
trees
but
all
wild
and
very
few
bearing
any
fruit
at
least
not
then
however
the
green
limes
that
i
gathered
were
not
only
pleasant
to
eat
but
very
wholesome
and
i
mixed
their
juice
afterwards
with
water
which
made
it
very
wholesome
and
very
cool
and
refreshing
i
found
now
i
had
business
enough
to
gather
and
carry
home
and
i
resolved
to
lay
up
a
store
as
well
of
grapes
as
limes
and
lemons
to
furnish
myself
for
the
wet
season
which
i
knew
was
approaching
in
order
to
do
this
i
gathered
a
great
heap
of
grapes
in
one
place
a
lesser
heap
in
another
place
and
a
great
parcel
of
limes
and
lemons
in
another
place
and
taking
a
few
of
each
with
me
i
travelled
homewards
resolving
to
come
again
and
bring
a
bag
or
sack
or
what
i
could
make
to
carry
the
rest
home
accordingly
having
spent
three
days
in
this
journey
i
came
home
so
i
must
now
call
my
tent
and
my
cave
but
before
i
got
thither
the
grapes
were
spoiled
the
richness
of
the
fruit
and
the
weight
of
the
juice
having
broken
them
and
bruised
them
they
were
good
for
little
or
nothing
as
to
the
limes
they
were
good
but
i
could
bring
but
a
few
the
next
day
being
the
nineteenth
i
went
back
having
made
me
two
small
bags
to
bring
home
my
harvest
but
i
was
surprised
when
coming
to
my
heap
of
grapes
which
were
so
rich
and
fine
when
i
gathered
them
to
find
them
all
spread
about
trod
to
pieces
and
dragged
about
some
here
some
there
and
abundance
eaten
and
devoured
by
this
i
concluded
there
were
some
wild
creatures
thereabouts
which
had
done
this
but
what
they
were
i
knew
not
however
as
i
found
there
was
no
laying
them
up
on
heaps
and
no
carrying
them
away
in
a
sack
but
that
one
way
they
would
be
destroyed
and
the
other
way
they
would
be
crushed
with
their
own
weight
i
took
another
course
for
i
gathered
a
large
quantity
of
the
grapes
and
hung
upon
the
out
branches
of
the
trees
that
they
might
cure
and
dry
in
the
sun
and
as
for
the
limes
and
lemons
i
carried
as
many
back
as
i
could
well
stand
under
when
i
came
home
from
this
journey
i
contemplated
with
great
pleasure
the
fruitfulness
of
that
valley
and
the
pleasantness
of
the
situation
the
security
from
storms
on
that
side
of
the
water
and
the
wood
and
concluded
that
i
had
pitched
upon
a
place
to
fix
my
abode
which
was
by
far
the
worst
part
of
the
country
upon
the
whole
i
began
to
consider
of
removing
my
habitation
and
looking
out
for
a
place
equally
safe
as
where
now
i
was
situate
if
possible
in
that
pleasant
fruitful
part
of
the
island
this
thought
ran
long
in
my
head
and
i
was
exceeding
fond
of
it
for
some
time
the
pleasantness
of
the
place
tempting
me
but
when
i
came
to
a
nearer
view
of
it
i
considered
that
i
was
now
by
the
seaside
where
it
was
at
least
possible
that
something
might
happen
to
my
advantage
and
by
the
same
ill
fate
that
brought
me
hither
might
bring
some
other
unhappy
wretches
to
the
same
place
and
though
it
was
scarce
probable
that
any
such
thing
should
ever
happen
yet
to
enclose
myself
among
the
hills
and
woods
in
the
centre
of
the
island
was
to
anticipate
my
bondage
and
to
render
such
an
affair
not
only
improbable
but
impossible
and
that
therefore
i
ought
not
by
any
means
to
remove
however
i
was
so
enamoured
of
this
place
that
i
spent
much
of
my
time
there
for
the
whole
of
the
remaining
part
of
the
month
of
july
and
though
upon
second
thoughts
i
resolved
not
to
remove
yet
i
built
me
a
little
kind
of
a
bower
and
surrounded
it
at
a
distance
with
a
strong
fence
being
a
double
hedge
as
high
as
i
could
reach
well
staked
and
filled
between
with
brushwood
and
here
i
lay
very
secure
sometimes
two
or
three
nights
together
always
going
over
it
with
a
ladder
so
that
i
fancied
now
i
had
my
country
house
and
my
sea
coast
house
and
this
work
took
me
up
to
the
beginning
of
august
i
had
but
newly
finished
my
fence
and
began
to
enjoy
my
labour
when
the
rains
came
on
and
made
me
stick
close
to
my
first
habitation
for
though
i
had
made
me
a
tent
like
the
other
with
a
piece
of
a
sail
and
spread
it
very
well
yet
i
had
not
the
shelter
of
a
hill
to
keep
me
from
storms
nor
a
cave
behind
me
to
retreat
into
when
the
rains
were
extraordinary
about
the
beginning
of
august
as
i
said
i
had
finished
my
bower
and
began
to
enjoy
myself
the
rd
of
august
i
found
the
grapes
i
had
hung
up
perfectly
dried
and
indeed
were
excellent
good
raisins
of
the
sun
so
i
began
to
take
them
down
from
the
trees
and
it
was
very
happy
that
i
did
so
for
the
rains
which
followed
would
have
spoiled
them
and
i
had
lost
the
best
part
of
my
winter
food
for
i
had
above
two
hundred
large
bunches
of
them
no
sooner
had
i
taken
them
all
down
and
carried
the
most
of
them
home
to
my
cave
than
it
began
to
rain
and
from
hence
which
was
the
th
of
august
it
rained
more
or
less
every
day
till
the
middle
of
october
and
sometimes
so
violently
that
i
could
not
stir
out
of
my
cave
for
several
days
in
this
season
i
was
much
surprised
with
the
increase
of
my
family
i
had
been
concerned
for
the
loss
of
one
of
my
cats
who
ran
away
from
me
or
as
i
thought
had
been
dead
and
i
heard
no
more
tidings
of
her
till
to
my
astonishment
she
came
home
about
the
end
of
august
with
three
kittens
this
was
the
more
strange
to
me
because
though
i
had
killed
a
wild
cat
as
i
called
it
with
my
gun
yet
i
thought
it
was
quite
a
different
kind
from
our
european
cats
but
the
young
cats
were
the
same
kind
of
house
breed
as
the
old
one
and
both
my
cats
being
females
i
thought
it
very
strange
but
from
these
three
cats
i
afterwards
came
to
be
so
pestered
with
cats
that
i
was
forced
to
kill
them
like
vermin
or
wild
beasts
and
to
drive
them
from
my
house
as
much
as
possible
from
the
th
of
august
to
the
th
incessant
rain
so
that
i
could
not
stir
and
was
now
very
careful
not
to
be
much
wet
in
this
confinement
i
began
to
be
straitened
for
food
but
venturing
out
twice
i
one
day
killed
a
goat
and
the
last
day
which
was
the
th
found
a
very
large
tortoise
which
was
a
treat
to
me
and
my
food
was
regulated
thus
i
ate
a
bunch
of
raisins
for
my
breakfast
a
piece
of
the
goat
s
flesh
or
of
the
turtle
for
my
dinner
broiled
for
to
my
great
misfortune
i
had
no
vessel
to
boil
or
stew
anything
and
two
or
three
of
the
turtle
s
eggs
for
my
supper
during
this
confinement
in
my
cover
by
the
rain
i
worked
daily
two
or
three
hours
at
enlarging
my
cave
and
by
degrees
worked
it
on
towards
one
side
till
i
came
to
the
outside
of
the
hill
and
made
a
door
or
way
out
which
came
beyond
my
fence
or
wall
and
so
i
came
in
and
out
this
way
but
i
was
not
perfectly
easy
at
lying
so
open
for
as
i
had
managed
myself
before
i
was
in
a
perfect
enclosure
whereas
now
i
thought
i
lay
exposed
and
open
for
anything
to
come
in
upon
me
and
yet
i
could
not
perceive
that
there
was
any
living
thing
to
fear
the
biggest
creature
that
i
had
yet
seen
upon
the
island
being
a
goat
sept
i
was
now
come
to
the
unhappy
anniversary
of
my
landing
i
cast
up
the
notches
on
my
post
and
found
i
had
been
on
shore
three
hundred
and
sixty
five
days
i
kept
this
day
as
a
solemn
fast
setting
it
apart
for
religious
exercise
prostrating
myself
on
the
ground
with
the
most
serious
humiliation
confessing
my
sins
to
god
acknowledging
his
righteous
judgments
upon
me
and
praying
to
him
to
have
mercy
on
me
through
jesus
christ
and
not
having
tasted
the
least
refreshment
for
twelve
hours
even
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
i
then
ate
a
biscuit
cake
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
went
to
bed
finishing
the
day
as
i
began
it
i
had
all
this
time
observed
no
sabbath
day
for
as
at
first
i
had
no
sense
of
religion
upon
my
mind
i
had
after
some
time
omitted
to
distinguish
the
weeks
by
making
a
longer
notch
than
ordinary
for
the
sabbath
day
and
so
did
not
really
know
what
any
of
the
days
were
but
now
having
cast
up
the
days
as
above
i
found
i
had
been
there
a
year
so
i
divided
it
into
weeks
and
set
apart
every
seventh
day
for
a
sabbath
though
i
found
at
the
end
of
my
account
i
had
lost
a
day
or
two
in
my
reckoning
a
little
after
this
my
ink
began
to
fail
me
and
so
i
contented
myself
to
use
it
more
sparingly
and
to
write
down
only
the
most
remarkable
events
of
my
life
without
continuing
a
daily
memorandum
of
other
things
the
rainy
season
and
the
dry
season
began
now
to
appear
regular
to
me
and
i
learned
to
divide
them
so
as
to
provide
for
them
accordingly
but
i
bought
all
my
experience
before
i
had
it
and
this
i
am
going
to
relate
was
one
of
the
most
discouraging
experiments
that
i
made
i
have
mentioned
that
i
had
saved
the
few
ears
of
barley
and
rice
which
i
had
so
surprisingly
found
spring
up
as
i
thought
of
themselves
and
i
believe
there
were
about
thirty
stalks
of
rice
and
about
twenty
of
barley
and
now
i
thought
it
a
proper
time
to
sow
it
after
the
rains
the
sun
being
in
its
southern
position
going
from
me
accordingly
i
dug
up
a
piece
of
ground
as
well
as
i
could
with
my
wooden
spade
and
dividing
it
into
two
parts
i
sowed
my
grain
but
as
i
was
sowing
it
casually
occurred
to
my
thoughts
that
i
would
not
sow
it
all
at
first
because
i
did
not
know
when
was
the
proper
time
for
it
so
i
sowed
about
two
thirds
of
the
seed
leaving
about
a
handful
of
each
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
afterwards
that
i
did
so
for
not
one
grain
of
what
i
sowed
this
time
came
to
anything
for
the
dry
months
following
the
earth
having
had
no
rain
after
the
seed
was
sown
it
had
no
moisture
to
assist
its
growth
and
never
came
up
at
all
till
the
wet
season
had
come
again
and
then
it
grew
as
if
it
had
been
but
newly
sown
finding
my
first
seed
did
not
grow
which
i
easily
imagined
was
by
the
drought
i
sought
for
a
moister
piece
of
ground
to
make
another
trial
in
and
i
dug
up
a
piece
of
ground
near
my
new
bower
and
sowed
the
rest
of
my
seed
in
february
a
little
before
the
vernal
equinox
and
this
having
the
rainy
months
of
march
and
april
to
water
it
sprung
up
very
pleasantly
and
yielded
a
very
good
crop
but
having
part
of
the
seed
left
only
and
not
daring
to
sow
all
that
i
had
i
had
but
a
small
quantity
at
last
my
whole
crop
not
amounting
to
above
half
a
peck
of
each
kind
but
by
this
experiment
i
was
made
master
of
my
business
and
knew
exactly
when
the
proper
season
was
to
sow
and
that
i
might
expect
two
seed
times
and
two
harvests
every
year
while
this
corn
was
growing
i
made
a
little
discovery
which
was
of
use
to
me
afterwards
as
soon
as
the
rains
were
over
and
the
weather
began
to
settle
which
was
about
the
month
of
november
i
made
a
visit
up
the
country
to
my
bower
where
though
i
had
not
been
some
months
yet
i
found
all
things
just
as
i
left
them
the
circle
or
double
hedge
that
i
had
made
was
not
only
firm
and
entire
but
the
stakes
which
i
had
cut
out
of
some
trees
that
grew
thereabouts
were
all
shot
out
and
grown
with
long
branches
as
much
as
a
willow
tree
usually
shoots
the
first
year
after
lopping
its
head
i
could
not
tell
what
tree
to
call
it
that
these
stakes
were
cut
from
i
was
surprised
and
yet
very
well
pleased
to
see
the
young
trees
grow
and
i
pruned
them
and
led
them
up
to
grow
as
much
alike
as
i
could
and
it
is
scarce
credible
how
beautiful
a
figure
they
grew
into
in
three
years
so
that
though
the
hedge
made
a
circle
of
about
twenty
five
yards
in
diameter
yet
the
trees
for
such
i
might
now
call
them
soon
covered
it
and
it
was
a
complete
shade
sufficient
to
lodge
under
all
the
dry
season
this
made
me
resolve
to
cut
some
more
stakes
and
make
me
a
hedge
like
this
in
a
semi
circle
round
my
wall
i
mean
that
of
my
first
dwelling
which
i
did
and
placing
the
trees
or
stakes
in
a
double
row
at
about
eight
yards
distance
from
my
first
fence
they
grew
presently
and
were
at
first
a
fine
cover
to
my
habitation
and
afterwards
served
for
a
defence
also
as
i
shall
observe
in
its
order
i
found
now
that
the
seasons
of
the
year
might
generally
be
divided
not
into
summer
and
winter
as
in
europe
but
into
the
rainy
seasons
and
the
dry
seasons
which
were
generally
thus
the
half
of
february
the
whole
of
march
and
the
half
of
april
rainy
the
sun
being
then
on
or
near
the
equinox
the
half
of
april
the
whole
of
may
june
and
july
and
the
half
of
august
dry
the
sun
being
then
to
the
north
of
the
line
the
half
of
august
the
whole
of
september
and
the
half
of
october
rainy
the
sun
being
then
come
back
the
half
of
october
the
whole
of
november
december
and
january
and
the
half
of
february
dry
the
sun
being
then
to
the
south
of
the
line
the
rainy
seasons
sometimes
held
longer
or
shorter
as
the
winds
happened
to
blow
but
this
was
the
general
observation
i
made
after
i
had
found
by
experience
the
ill
consequences
of
being
abroad
in
the
rain
i
took
care
to
furnish
myself
with
provisions
beforehand
that
i
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
out
and
i
sat
within
doors
as
much
as
possible
during
the
wet
months
this
time
i
found
much
employment
and
very
suitable
also
to
the
time
for
i
found
great
occasion
for
many
things
which
i
had
no
way
to
furnish
myself
with
but
by
hard
labour
and
constant
application
particularly
i
tried
many
ways
to
make
myself
a
basket
but
all
the
twigs
i
could
get
for
the
purpose
proved
so
brittle
that
they
would
do
nothing
it
proved
of
excellent
advantage
to
me
now
that
when
i
was
a
boy
i
used
to
take
great
delight
in
standing
at
a
basket
maker
s
in
the
town
where
my
father
lived
to
see
them
make
their
wicker
ware
and
being
as
boys
usually
are
very
officious
to
help
and
a
great
observer
of
the
manner
in
which
they
worked
those
things
and
sometimes
lending
a
hand
i
had
by
these
means
full
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
it
and
i
wanted
nothing
but
the
materials
when
it
came
into
my
mind
that
the
twigs
of
that
tree
from
whence
i
cut
my
stakes
that
grew
might
possibly
be
as
tough
as
the
sallows
willows
and
osiers
in
england
and
i
resolved
to
try
accordingly
the
next
day
i
went
to
my
country
house
as
i
called
it
and
cutting
some
of
the
smaller
twigs
i
found
them
to
my
purpose
as
much
as
i
could
desire
whereupon
i
came
the
next
time
prepared
with
a
hatchet
to
cut
down
a
quantity
which
i
soon
found
for
there
was
great
plenty
of
them
these
i
set
up
to
dry
within
my
circle
or
hedge
and
when
they
were
fit
for
use
i
carried
them
to
my
cave
and
here
during
the
next
season
i
employed
myself
in
making
as
well
as
i
could
a
great
many
baskets
both
to
carry
earth
or
to
carry
or
lay
up
anything
as
i
had
occasion
and
though
i
did
not
finish
them
very
handsomely
yet
i
made
them
sufficiently
serviceable
for
my
purpose
thus
afterwards
i
took
care
never
to
be
without
them
and
as
my
wicker
ware
decayed
i
made
more
especially
strong
deep
baskets
to
place
my
corn
in
instead
of
sacks
when
i
should
come
to
have
any
quantity
of
it
having
mastered
this
difficulty
and
employed
a
world
of
time
about
it
i
bestirred
myself
to
see
if
possible
how
to
supply
two
wants
i
had
no
vessels
to
hold
anything
that
was
liquid
except
two
runlets
which
were
almost
full
of
rum
and
some
glass
bottles
some
of
the
common
size
and
others
which
were
case
bottles
square
for
the
holding
of
water
spirits
c
i
had
not
so
much
as
a
pot
to
boil
anything
except
a
great
kettle
which
i
saved
out
of
the
ship
and
which
was
too
big
for
such
as
i
desired
it
viz
to
make
broth
and
stew
a
bit
of
meat
by
itself
the
second
thing
i
fain
would
have
had
was
a
tobacco
pipe
but
it
was
impossible
to
me
to
make
one
however
i
found
a
contrivance
for
that
too
at
last
i
employed
myself
in
planting
my
second
rows
of
stakes
or
piles
and
in
this
wicker
working
all
the
summer
or
dry
season
when
another
business
took
me
up
more
time
than
it
could
be
imagined
i
could
spare
chapter
viii
surveys
his
position
i
mentioned
before
that
i
had
a
great
mind
to
see
the
whole
island
and
that
i
had
travelled
up
the
brook
and
so
on
to
where
i
built
my
bower
and
where
i
had
an
opening
quite
to
the
sea
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
i
now
resolved
to
travel
quite
across
to
the
sea
shore
on
that
side
so
taking
my
gun
a
hatchet
and
my
dog
and
a
larger
quantity
of
powder
and
shot
than
usual
with
two
biscuit
cakes
and
a
great
bunch
of
raisins
in
my
pouch
for
my
store
i
began
my
journey
when
i
had
passed
the
vale
where
my
bower
stood
as
above
i
came
within
view
of
the
sea
to
the
west
and
it
being
a
very
clear
day
i
fairly
descried
land
whether
an
island
or
a
continent
i
could
not
tell
but
it
lay
very
high
extending
from
the
w
to
the
w
s
w
at
a
very
great
distance
by
my
guess
it
could
not
be
less
than
fifteen
or
twenty
leagues
off
i
could
not
tell
what
part
of
the
world
this
might
be
otherwise
than
that
i
knew
it
must
be
part
of
america
and
as
i
concluded
by
all
my
observations
must
be
near
the
spanish
dominions
and
perhaps
was
all
inhabited
by
savages
where
if
i
had
landed
i
had
been
in
a
worse
condition
than
i
was
now
and
therefore
i
acquiesced
in
the
dispositions
of
providence
which
i
began
now
to
own
and
to
believe
ordered
everything
for
the
best
i
say
i
quieted
my
mind
with
this
and
left
off
afflicting
myself
with
fruitless
wishes
of
being
there
besides
after
some
thought
upon
this
affair
i
considered
that
if
this
land
was
the
spanish
coast
i
should
certainly
one
time
or
other
see
some
vessel
pass
or
repass
one
way
or
other
but
if
not
then
it
was
the
savage
coast
between
the
spanish
country
and
brazils
where
are
found
the
worst
of
savages
for
they
are
cannibals
or
men
eaters
and
fail
not
to
murder
and
devour
all
the
human
bodies
that
fall
into
their
hands
with
these
considerations
i
walked
very
leisurely
forward
i
found
that
side
of
the
island
where
i
now
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
the
open
or
savannah
fields
sweet
adorned
with
flowers
and
grass
and
full
of
very
fine
woods
i
saw
abundance
of
parrots
and
fain
i
would
have
caught
one
if
possible
to
have
kept
it
to
be
tame
and
taught
it
to
speak
to
me
i
did
after
some
painstaking
catch
a
young
parrot
for
i
knocked
it
down
with
a
stick
and
having
recovered
it
i
brought
it
home
but
it
was
some
years
before
i
could
make
him
speak
however
at
last
i
taught
him
to
call
me
by
name
very
familiarly
but
the
accident
that
followed
though
it
be
a
trifle
will
be
very
diverting
in
its
place
i
was
exceedingly
diverted
with
this
journey
i
found
in
the
low
grounds
hares
as
i
thought
them
to
be
and
foxes
but
they
differed
greatly
from
all
the
other
kinds
i
had
met
with
nor
could
i
satisfy
myself
to
eat
them
though
i
killed
several
but
i
had
no
need
to
be
venturous
for
i
had
no
want
of
food
and
of
that
which
was
very
good
too
especially
these
three
sorts
viz
goats
pigeons
and
turtle
or
tortoise
which
added
to
my
grapes
leadenhall
market
could
not
have
furnished
a
table
better
than
i
in
proportion
to
the
company
and
though
my
case
was
deplorable
enough
yet
i
had
great
cause
for
thankfulness
that
i
was
not
driven
to
any
extremities
for
food
but
had
rather
plenty
even
to
dainties
i
never
travelled
in
this
journey
above
two
miles
outright
in
a
day
or
thereabouts
but
i
took
so
many
turns
and
re
turns
to
see
what
discoveries
i
could
make
that
i
came
weary
enough
to
the
place
where
i
resolved
to
sit
down
all
night
and
then
i
either
reposed
myself
in
a
tree
or
surrounded
myself
with
a
row
of
stakes
set
upright
in
the
ground
either
from
one
tree
to
another
or
so
as
no
wild
creature
could
come
at
me
without
waking
me
as
soon
as
i
came
to
the
sea
shore
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
i
had
taken
up
my
lot
on
the
worst
side
of
the
island
for
here
indeed
the
shore
was
covered
with
innumerable
turtles
whereas
on
the
other
side
i
had
found
but
three
in
a
year
and
a
half
here
was
also
an
infinite
number
of
fowls
of
many
kinds
some
which
i
had
seen
and
some
which
i
had
not
seen
before
and
many
of
them
very
good
meat
but
such
as
i
knew
not
the
names
of
except
those
called
penguins
i
could
have
shot
as
many
as
i
pleased
but
was
very
sparing
of
my
powder
and
shot
and
therefore
had
more
mind
to
kill
a
she
goat
if
i
could
which
i
could
better
feed
on
and
though
there
were
many
goats
here
more
than
on
my
side
the
island
yet
it
was
with
much
more
difficulty
that
i
could
come
near
them
the
country
being
flat
and
even
and
they
saw
me
much
sooner
than
when
i
was
on
the
hills
i
confess
this
side
of
the
country
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
but
yet
i
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remove
for
as
i
was
fixed
in
my
habitation
it
became
natural
to
me
and
i
seemed
all
the
while
i
was
here
to
be
as
it
were
upon
a
journey
and
from
home
however
i
travelled
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
towards
the
east
i
suppose
about
twelve
miles
and
then
setting
up
a
great
pole
upon
the
shore
for
a
mark
i
concluded
i
would
go
home
again
and
that
the
next
journey
i
took
should
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
east
from
my
dwelling
and
so
round
till
i
came
to
my
post
again
i
took
another
way
to
come
back
than
that
i
went
thinking
i
could
easily
keep
all
the
island
so
much
in
my
view
that
i
could
not
miss
finding
my
first
dwelling
by
viewing
the
country
but
i
found
myself
mistaken
for
being
come
about
two
or
three
miles
i
found
myself
descended
into
a
very
large
valley
but
so
surrounded
with
hills
and
those
hills
covered
with
wood
that
i
could
not
see
which
was
my
way
by
any
direction
but
that
of
the
sun
nor
even
then
unless
i
knew
very
well
the
position
of
the
sun
at
that
time
of
the
day
it
happened
to
my
further
misfortune
that
the
weather
proved
hazy
for
three
or
four
days
while
i
was
in
the
valley
and
not
being
able
to
see
the
sun
i
wandered
about
very
uncomfortably
and
at
last
was
obliged
to
find
the
seaside
look
for
my
post
and
come
back
the
same
way
i
went
and
then
by
easy
journeys
i
turned
homeward
the
weather
being
exceeding
hot
and
my
gun
ammunition
hatchet
and
other
things
very
heavy
in
this
journey
my
dog
surprised
a
young
kid
and
seized
upon
it
and
i
running
in
to
take
hold
of
it
caught
it
and
saved
it
alive
from
the
dog
i
had
a
great
mind
to
bring
it
home
if
i
could
for
i
had
often
been
musing
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
to
get
a
kid
or
two
and
so
raise
a
breed
of
tame
goats
which
might
supply
me
when
my
powder
and
shot
should
be
all
spent
i
made
a
collar
for
this
little
creature
and
with
a
string
which
i
made
of
some
rope
yam
which
i
always
carried
about
me
i
led
him
along
though
with
some
difficulty
till
i
came
to
my
bower
and
there
i
enclosed
him
and
left
him
for
i
was
very
impatient
to
be
at
home
from
whence
i
had
been
absent
above
a
month
i
cannot
express
what
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
me
to
come
into
my
old
hutch
and
lie
down
in
my
hammock
bed
this
little
wandering
journey
without
settled
place
of
abode
had
been
so
unpleasant
to
me
that
my
own
house
as
i
called
it
to
myself
was
a
perfect
settlement
to
me
compared
to
that
and
it
rendered
everything
about
me
so
comfortable
that
i
resolved
i
would
never
go
a
great
way
from
it
again
while
it
should
be
my
lot
to
stay
on
the
island
i
reposed
myself
here
a
week
to
rest
and
regale
myself
after
my
long
journey
during
which
most
of
the
time
was
taken
up
in
the
weighty
affair
of
making
a
cage
for
my
poll
who
began
now
to
be
a
mere
domestic
and
to
be
well
acquainted
with
me
then
i
began
to
think
of
the
poor
kid
which
i
had
penned
in
within
my
little
circle
and
resolved
to
go
and
fetch
it
home
or
give
it
some
food
accordingly
i
went
and
found
it
where
i
left
it
for
indeed
it
could
not
get
out
but
was
almost
starved
for
want
of
food
i
went
and
cut
boughs
of
trees
and
branches
of
such
shrubs
as
i
could
find
and
threw
it
over
and
having
fed
it
i
tied
it
as
i
did
before
to
lead
it
away
but
it
was
so
tame
with
being
hungry
that
i
had
no
need
to
have
tied
it
for
it
followed
me
like
a
dog
and
as
i
continually
fed
it
the
creature
became
so
loving
so
gentle
and
so
fond
that
it
became
from
that
time
one
of
my
domestics
also
and
would
never
leave
me
afterwards
the
rainy
season
of
the
autumnal
equinox
was
now
come
and
i
kept
the
th
of
september
in
the
same
solemn
manner
as
before
being
the
anniversary
of
my
landing
on
the
island
having
now
been
there
two
years
and
no
more
prospect
of
being
delivered
than
the
first
day
i
came
there
i
spent
the
whole
day
in
humble
and
thankful
acknowledgments
of
the
many
wonderful
mercies
which
my
solitary
condition
was
attended
with
and
without
which
it
might
have
been
infinitely
more
miserable
i
gave
humble
and
hearty
thanks
that
god
had
been
pleased
to
discover
to
me
that
it
was
possible
i
might
be
more
happy
in
this
solitary
condition
than
i
should
have
been
in
the
liberty
of
society
and
in
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
that
he
could
fully
make
up
to
me
the
deficiencies
of
my
solitary
state
and
the
want
of
human
society
by
his
presence
and
the
communications
of
his
grace
to
my
soul
supporting
comforting
and
encouraging
me
to
depend
upon
his
providence
here
and
hope
for
his
eternal
presence
hereafter
it
was
now
that
i
began
sensibly
to
feel
how
much
more
happy
this
life
i
now
led
was
with
all
its
miserable
circumstances
than
the
wicked
cursed
abominable
life
i
led
all
the
past
part
of
my
days
and
now
i
changed
both
my
sorrows
and
my
joys
my
very
desires
altered
my
affections
changed
their
gusts
and
my
delights
were
perfectly
new
from
what
they
were
at
my
first
coming
or
indeed
for
the
two
years
past
before
as
i
walked
about
either
on
my
hunting
or
for
viewing
the
country
the
anguish
of
my
soul
at
my
condition
would
break
out
upon
me
on
a
sudden
and
my
very
heart
would
die
within
me
to
think
of
the
woods
the
mountains
the
deserts
i
was
in
and
how
i
was
a
prisoner
locked
up
with
the
eternal
bars
and
bolts
of
the
ocean
in
an
uninhabited
wilderness
without
redemption
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
composure
of
my
mind
this
would
break
out
upon
me
like
a
storm
and
make
me
wring
my
hands
and
weep
like
a
child
sometimes
it
would
take
me
in
the
middle
of
my
work
and
i
would
immediately
sit
down
and
sigh
and
look
upon
the
ground
for
an
hour
or
two
together
and
this
was
still
worse
to
me
for
if
i
could
burst
out
into
tears
or
vent
myself
by
words
it
would
go
off
and
the
grief
having
exhausted
itself
would
abate
but
now
i
began
to
exercise
myself
with
new
thoughts
i
daily
read
the
word
of
god
and
applied
all
the
comforts
of
it
to
my
present
state
one
morning
being
very
sad
i
opened
the
bible
upon
these
words
i
will
never
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
immediately
it
occurred
that
these
words
were
to
me
why
else
should
they
be
directed
in
such
a
manner
just
at
the
moment
when
i
was
mourning
over
my
condition
as
one
forsaken
of
god
and
man
well
then
said
i
if
god
does
not
forsake
me
of
what
ill
consequence
can
it
be
or
what
matters
it
though
the
world
should
all
forsake
me
seeing
on
the
other
hand
if
i
had
all
the
world
and
should
lose
the
favour
and
blessing
of
god
there
would
be
no
comparison
in
the
loss
from
this
moment
i
began
to
conclude
in
my
mind
that
it
was
possible
for
me
to
be
more
happy
in
this
forsaken
solitary
condition
than
it
was
probable
i
should
ever
have
been
in
any
other
particular
state
in
the
world
and
with
this
thought
i
was
going
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
bringing
me
to
this
place
i
know
not
what
it
was
but
something
shocked
my
mind
at
that
thought
and
i
durst
not
speak
the
words
how
canst
thou
become
such
a
hypocrite
said
i
even
audibly
to
pretend
to
be
thankful
for
a
condition
which
however
thou
mayest
endeavour
to
be
contented
with
thou
wouldst
rather
pray
heartily
to
be
delivered
from
so
i
stopped
there
but
though
i
could
not
say
i
thanked
god
for
being
there
yet
i
sincerely
gave
thanks
to
god
for
opening
my
eyes
by
whatever
afflicting
providences
to
see
the
former
condition
of
my
life
and
to
mourn
for
my
wickedness
and
repent
i
never
opened
the
bible
or
shut
it
but
my
very
soul
within
me
blessed
god
for
directing
my
friend
in
england
without
any
order
of
mine
to
pack
it
up
among
my
goods
and
for
assisting
me
afterwards
to
save
it
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
thus
and
in
this
disposition
of
mind
i
began
my
third
year
and
though
i
have
not
given
the
reader
the
trouble
of
so
particular
an
account
of
my
works
this
year
as
the
first
yet
in
general
it
may
be
observed
that
i
was
very
seldom
idle
but
having
regularly
divided
my
time
according
to
the
several
daily
employments
that
were
before
me
such
as
first
my
duty
to
god
and
the
reading
the
scriptures
which
i
constantly
set
apart
some
time
for
thrice
every
day
secondly
the
going
abroad
with
my
gun
for
food
which
generally
took
me
up
three
hours
in
every
morning
when
it
did
not
rain
thirdly
the
ordering
cutting
preserving
and
cooking
what
i
had
killed
or
caught
for
my
supply
these
took
up
great
part
of
the
day
also
it
is
to
be
considered
that
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
sun
was
in
the
zenith
the
violence
of
the
heat
was
too
great
to
stir
out
so
that
about
four
hours
in
the
evening
was
all
the
time
i
could
be
supposed
to
work
in
with
this
exception
that
sometimes
i
changed
my
hours
of
hunting
and
working
and
went
to
work
in
the
morning
and
abroad
with
my
gun
in
the
afternoon
to
this
short
time
allowed
for
labour
i
desire
may
be
added
the
exceeding
laboriousness
of
my
work
the
many
hours
which
for
want
of
tools
want
of
help
and
want
of
skill
everything
i
did
took
up
out
of
my
time
for
example
i
was
full
two
and
forty
days
in
making
a
board
for
a
long
shelf
which
i
wanted
in
my
cave
whereas
two
sawyers
with
their
tools
and
a
saw
pit
would
have
cut
six
of
them
out
of
the
same
tree
in
half
a
day
my
case
was
this
it
was
to
be
a
large
tree
which
was
to
be
cut
down
because
my
board
was
to
be
a
broad
one
this
tree
i
was
three
days
in
cutting
down
and
two
more
cutting
off
the
boughs
and
reducing
it
to
a
log
or
piece
of
timber
with
inexpressible
hacking
and
hewing
i
reduced
both
the
sides
of
it
into
chips
till
it
began
to
be
light
enough
to
move
then
i
turned
it
and
made
one
side
of
it
smooth
and
flat
as
a
board
from
end
to
end
then
turning
that
side
downward
cut
the
other
side
til
i
brought
the
plank
to
be
about
three
inches
thick
and
smooth
on
both
sides
any
one
may
judge
the
labour
of
my
hands
in
such
a
piece
of
work
but
labour
and
patience
carried
me
through
that
and
many
other
things
i
only
observe
this
in
particular
to
show
the
reason
why
so
much
of
my
time
went
away
with
so
little
work
viz
that
what
might
be
a
little
to
be
done
with
help
and
tools
was
a
vast
labour
and
required
a
prodigious
time
to
do
alone
and
by
hand
but
notwithstanding
this
with
patience
and
labour
i
got
through
everything
that
my
circumstances
made
necessary
to
me
to
do
as
will
appear
by
what
follows
i
was
now
in
the
months
of
november
and
december
expecting
my
crop
of
barley
and
rice
the
ground
i
had
manured
and
dug
up
for
them
was
not
great
for
as
i
observed
my
seed
of
each
was
not
above
the
quantity
of
half
a
peck
for
i
had
lost
one
whole
crop
by
sowing
in
the
dry
season
but
now
my
crop
promised
very
well
when
on
a
sudden
i
found
i
was
in
danger
of
losing
it
all
again
by
enemies
of
several
sorts
which
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
keep
from
it
as
first
the
goats
and
wild
creatures
which
i
called
hares
who
tasting
the
sweetness
of
the
blade
lay
in
it
night
and
day
as
soon
as
it
came
up
and
eat
it
so
close
that
it
could
get
no
time
to
shoot
up
into
stalk
this
i
saw
no
remedy
for
but
by
making
an
enclosure
about
it
with
a
hedge
which
i
did
with
a
great
deal
of
toil
and
the
more
because
it
required
speed
however
as
my
arable
land
was
but
small
suited
to
my
crop
i
got
it
totally
well
fenced
in
about
three
weeks
time
and
shooting
some
of
the
creatures
in
the
daytime
i
set
my
dog
to
guard
it
in
the
night
tying
him
up
to
a
stake
at
the
gate
where
he
would
stand
and
bark
all
night
long
so
in
a
little
time
the
enemies
forsook
the
place
and
the
corn
grew
very
strong
and
well
and
began
to
ripen
apace
but
as
the
beasts
ruined
me
before
while
my
corn
was
in
the
blade
so
the
birds
were
as
likely
to
ruin
me
now
when
it
was
in
the
ear
for
going
along
by
the
place
to
see
how
it
throve
i
saw
my
little
crop
surrounded
with
fowls
of
i
know
not
how
many
sorts
who
stood
as
it
were
watching
till
i
should
be
gone
i
immediately
let
fly
among
them
for
i
always
had
my
gun
with
me
i
had
no
sooner
shot
but
there
rose
up
a
little
cloud
of
fowls
which
i
had
not
seen
at
all
from
among
the
corn
itself
this
touched
me
sensibly
for
i
foresaw
that
in
a
few
days
they
would
devour
all
my
hopes
that
i
should
be
starved
and
never
be
able
to
raise
a
crop
at
all
and
what
to
do
i
could
not
tell
however
i
resolved
not
to
lose
my
corn
if
possible
though
i
should
watch
it
night
and
day
in
the
first
place
i
went
among
it
to
see
what
damage
was
already
done
and
found
they
had
spoiled
a
good
deal
of
it
but
that
as
it
was
yet
too
green
for
them
the
loss
was
not
so
great
but
that
the
remainder
was
likely
to
be
a
good
crop
if
it
could
be
saved
i
stayed
by
it
to
load
my
gun
and
then
coming
away
i
could
easily
see
the
thieves
sitting
upon
all
the
trees
about
me
as
if
they
only
waited
till
i
was
gone
away
and
the
event
proved
it
to
be
so
for
as
i
walked
off
as
if
i
was
gone
i
was
no
sooner
out
of
their
sight
than
they
dropped
down
one
by
one
into
the
corn
again
i
was
so
provoked
that
i
could
not
have
patience
to
stay
till
more
came
on
knowing
that
every
grain
that
they
ate
now
was
as
it
might
be
said
a
peck
loaf
to
me
in
the
consequence
but
coming
up
to
the
hedge
i
fired
again
and
killed
three
of
them
this
was
what
i
wished
for
so
i
took
them
up
and
served
them
as
we
serve
notorious
thieves
in
england
hanged
them
in
chains
for
a
terror
to
others
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
this
should
have
such
an
effect
as
it
had
for
the
fowls
would
not
only
not
come
at
the
corn
but
in
short
they
forsook
all
that
part
of
the
island
and
i
could
never
see
a
bird
near
the
place
as
long
as
my
scarecrows
hung
there
this
i
was
very
glad
of
you
may
be
sure
and
about
the
latter
end
of
december
which
was
our
second
harvest
of
the
year
i
reaped
my
corn
i
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
a
scythe
or
sickle
to
cut
it
down
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
make
one
as
well
as
i
could
out
of
one
of
the
broadswords
or
cutlasses
which
i
saved
among
the
arms
out
of
the
ship
however
as
my
first
crop
was
but
small
i
had
no
great
difficulty
to
cut
it
down
in
short
i
reaped
it
in
my
way
for
i
cut
nothing
off
but
the
ears
and
carried
it
away
in
a
great
basket
which
i
had
made
and
so
rubbed
it
out
with
my
hands
and
at
the
end
of
all
my
harvesting
i
found
that
out
of
my
half
peck
of
seed
i
had
near
two
bushels
of
rice
and
about
two
bushels
and
a
half
of
barley
that
is
to
say
by
my
guess
for
i
had
no
measure
at
that
time
however
this
was
a
great
encouragement
to
me
and
i
foresaw
that
in
time
it
would
please
god
to
supply
me
with
bread
and
yet
here
i
was
perplexed
again
for
i
neither
knew
how
to
grind
or
make
meal
of
my
corn
or
indeed
how
to
clean
it
and
part
it
nor
if
made
into
meal
how
to
make
bread
of
it
and
if
how
to
make
it
yet
i
knew
not
how
to
bake
it
these
things
being
added
to
my
desire
of
having
a
good
quantity
for
store
and
to
secure
a
constant
supply
i
resolved
not
to
taste
any
of
this
crop
but
to
preserve
it
all
for
seed
against
the
next
season
and
in
the
meantime
to
employ
all
my
study
and
hours
of
working
to
accomplish
this
great
work
of
providing
myself
with
corn
and
bread
it
might
be
truly
said
that
now
i
worked
for
my
bread
i
believe
few
people
have
thought
much
upon
the
strange
multitude
of
little
things
necessary
in
the
providing
producing
curing
dressing
making
and
finishing
this
one
article
of
bread
i
that
was
reduced
to
a
mere
state
of
nature
found
this
to
my
daily
discouragement
and
was
made
more
sensible
of
it
every
hour
even
after
i
had
got
the
first
handful
of
seed
corn
which
as
i
have
said
came
up
unexpectedly
and
indeed
to
a
surprise
first
i
had
no
plough
to
turn
up
the
earth
no
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
it
well
this
i
conquered
by
making
me
a
wooden
spade
as
i
observed
before
but
this
did
my
work
but
in
a
wooden
manner
and
though
it
cost
me
a
great
many
days
to
make
it
yet
for
want
of
iron
it
not
only
wore
out
soon
but
made
my
work
the
harder
and
made
it
be
performed
much
worse
however
this
i
bore
with
and
was
content
to
work
it
out
with
patience
and
bear
with
the
badness
of
the
performance
when
the
corn
was
sown
i
had
no
harrow
but
was
forced
to
go
over
it
myself
and
drag
a
great
heavy
bough
of
a
tree
over
it
to
scratch
it
as
it
may
be
called
rather
than
rake
or
harrow
it
when
it
was
growing
and
grown
i
have
observed
already
how
many
things
i
wanted
to
fence
it
secure
it
mow
or
reap
it
cure
and
carry
it
home
thrash
part
it
from
the
chaff
and
save
it
then
i
wanted
a
mill
to
grind
it
sieves
to
dress
it
yeast
and
salt
to
make
it
into
bread
and
an
oven
to
bake
it
but
all
these
things
i
did
without
as
shall
be
observed
and
yet
the
corn
was
an
inestimable
comfort
and
advantage
to
me
too
all
this
as
i
said
made
everything
laborious
and
tedious
to
me
but
that
there
was
no
help
for
neither
was
my
time
so
much
loss
to
me
because
as
i
had
divided
it
a
certain
part
of
it
was
every
day
appointed
to
these
works
and
as
i
had
resolved
to
use
none
of
the
corn
for
bread
till
i
had
a
greater
quantity
by
me
i
had
the
next
six
months
to
apply
myself
wholly
by
labour
and
invention
to
furnish
myself
with
utensils
proper
for
the
performing
all
the
operations
necessary
for
making
the
corn
when
i
had
it
fit
for
my
use
chapter
ix
a
boat
but
first
i
was
to
prepare
more
land
for
i
had
now
seed
enough
to
sow
above
an
acre
of
ground
before
i
did
this
i
had
a
week
s
work
at
least
to
make
me
a
spade
which
when
it
was
done
was
but
a
sorry
one
indeed
and
very
heavy
and
required
double
labour
to
work
with
it
however
i
got
through
that
and
sowed
my
seed
in
two
large
flat
pieces
of
ground
as
near
my
house
as
i
could
find
them
to
my
mind
and
fenced
them
in
with
a
good
hedge
the
stakes
of
which
were
all
cut
off
that
wood
which
i
had
set
before
and
knew
it
would
grow
so
that
in
a
year
s
time
i
knew
i
should
have
a
quick
or
living
hedge
that
would
want
but
little
repair
this
work
did
not
take
me
up
less
than
three
months
because
a
great
part
of
that
time
was
the
wet
season
when
i
could
not
go
abroad
within
doors
that
is
when
it
rained
and
i
could
not
go
out
i
found
employment
in
the
following
occupations
always
observing
that
all
the
while
i
was
at
work
i
diverted
myself
with
talking
to
my
parrot
and
teaching
him
to
speak
and
i
quickly
taught
him
to
know
his
own
name
and
at
last
to
speak
it
out
pretty
loud
poll
which
was
the
first
word
i
ever
heard
spoken
in
the
island
by
any
mouth
but
my
own
this
therefore
was
not
my
work
but
an
assistance
to
my
work
for
now
as
i
said
i
had
a
great
employment
upon
my
hands
as
follows
i
had
long
studied
to
make
by
some
means
or
other
some
earthen
vessels
which
indeed
i
wanted
sorely
but
knew
not
where
to
come
at
them
however
considering
the
heat
of
the
climate
i
did
not
doubt
but
if
i
could
find
out
any
clay
i
might
make
some
pots
that
might
being
dried
in
the
sun
be
hard
enough
and
strong
enough
to
bear
handling
and
to
hold
anything
that
was
dry
and
required
to
be
kept
so
and
as
this
was
necessary
in
the
preparing
corn
meal
c
which
was
the
thing
i
was
doing
i
resolved
to
make
some
as
large
as
i
could
and
fit
only
to
stand
like
jars
to
hold
what
should
be
put
into
them
it
would
make
the
reader
pity
me
or
rather
laugh
at
me
to
tell
how
many
awkward
ways
i
took
to
raise
this
paste
what
odd
misshapen
ugly
things
i
made
how
many
of
them
fell
in
and
how
many
fell
out
the
clay
not
being
stiff
enough
to
bear
its
own
weight
how
many
cracked
by
the
over
violent
heat
of
the
sun
being
set
out
too
hastily
and
how
many
fell
in
pieces
with
only
removing
as
well
before
as
after
they
were
dried
and
in
a
word
how
after
having
laboured
hard
to
find
the
clay
to
dig
it
to
temper
it
to
bring
it
home
and
work
it
i
could
not
make
above
two
large
earthen
ugly
things
i
cannot
call
them
jars
in
about
two
months
labour
however
as
the
sun
baked
these
two
very
dry
and
hard
i
lifted
them
very
gently
up
and
set
them
down
again
in
two
great
wicker
baskets
which
i
had
made
on
purpose
for
them
that
they
might
not
break
and
as
between
the
pot
and
the
basket
there
was
a
little
room
to
spare
i
stuffed
it
full
of
the
rice
and
barley
straw
and
these
two
pots
being
to
stand
always
dry
i
thought
would
hold
my
dry
corn
and
perhaps
the
meal
when
the
corn
was
bruised
though
i
miscarried
so
much
in
my
design
for
large
pots
yet
i
made
several
smaller
things
with
better
success
such
as
little
round
pots
flat
dishes
pitchers
and
pipkins
and
any
things
my
hand
turned
to
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
baked
them
quite
hard
but
all
this
would
not
answer
my
end
which
was
to
get
an
earthen
pot
to
hold
what
was
liquid
and
bear
the
fire
which
none
of
these
could
do
it
happened
after
some
time
making
a
pretty
large
fire
for
cooking
my
meat
when
i
went
to
put
it
out
after
i
had
done
with
it
i
found
a
broken
piece
of
one
of
my
earthenware
vessels
in
the
fire
burnt
as
hard
as
a
stone
and
red
as
a
tile
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
it
and
said
to
myself
that
certainly
they
might
be
made
to
burn
whole
if
they
would
burn
broken
this
set
me
to
study
how
to
order
my
fire
so
as
to
make
it
burn
some
pots
i
had
no
notion
of
a
kiln
such
as
the
potters
burn
in
or
of
glazing
them
with
lead
though
i
had
some
lead
to
do
it
with
but
i
placed
three
large
pipkins
and
two
or
three
pots
in
a
pile
one
upon
another
and
placed
my
firewood
all
round
it
with
a
great
heap
of
embers
under
them
i
plied
the
fire
with
fresh
fuel
round
the
outside
and
upon
the
top
till
i
saw
the
pots
in
the
inside
red
hot
quite
through
and
observed
that
they
did
not
crack
at
all
when
i
saw
them
clear
red
i
let
them
stand
in
that
heat
about
five
or
six
hours
till
i
found
one
of
them
though
it
did
not
crack
did
melt
or
run
for
the
sand
which
was
mixed
with
the
clay
melted
by
the
violence
of
the
heat
and
would
have
run
into
glass
if
i
had
gone
on
so
i
slacked
my
fire
gradually
till
the
pots
began
to
abate
of
the
red
colour
and
watching
them
all
night
that
i
might
not
let
the
fire
abate
too
fast
in
the
morning
i
had
three
very
good
i
will
not
say
handsome
pipkins
and
two
other
earthen
pots
as
hard
burnt
as
could
be
desired
and
one
of
them
perfectly
glazed
with
the
running
of
the
sand
after
this
experiment
i
need
not
say
that
i
wanted
no
sort
of
earthenware
for
my
use
but
i
must
needs
say
as
to
the
shapes
of
them
they
were
very
indifferent
as
any
one
may
suppose
when
i
had
no
way
of
making
them
but
as
the
children
make
dirt
pies
or
as
a
woman
would
make
pies
that
never
learned
to
raise
paste
no
joy
at
a
thing
of
so
mean
a
nature
was
ever
equal
to
mine
when
i
found
i
had
made
an
earthen
pot
that
would
bear
the
fire
and
i
had
hardly
patience
to
stay
till
they
were
cold
before
i
set
one
on
the
fire
again
with
some
water
in
it
to
boil
me
some
meat
which
it
did
admirably
well
and
with
a
piece
of
a
kid
i
made
some
very
good
broth
though
i
wanted
oatmeal
and
several
other
ingredients
requisite
to
make
it
as
good
as
i
would
have
had
it
been
my
next
concern
was
to
get
me
a
stone
mortar
to
stamp
or
beat
some
corn
in
for
as
to
the
mill
there
was
no
thought
of
arriving
at
that
perfection
of
art
with
one
pair
of
hands
to
supply
this
want
i
was
at
a
great
loss
for
of
all
the
trades
in
the
world
i
was
as
perfectly
unqualified
for
a
stone
cutter
as
for
any
whatever
neither
had
i
any
tools
to
go
about
it
with
i
spent
many
a
day
to
find
out
a
great
stone
big
enough
to
cut
hollow
and
make
fit
for
a
mortar
and
could
find
none
at
all
except
what
was
in
the
solid
rock
and
which
i
had
no
way
to
dig
or
cut
out
nor
indeed
were
the
rocks
in
the
island
of
hardness
sufficient
but
were
all
of
a
sandy
crumbling
stone
which
neither
would
bear
the
weight
of
a
heavy
pestle
nor
would
break
the
corn
without
filling
it
with
sand
so
after
a
great
deal
of
time
lost
in
searching
for
a
stone
i
gave
it
over
and
resolved
to
look
out
for
a
great
block
of
hard
wood
which
i
found
indeed
much
easier
and
getting
one
as
big
as
i
had
strength
to
stir
i
rounded
it
and
formed
it
on
the
outside
with
my
axe
and
hatchet
and
then
with
the
help
of
fire
and
infinite
labour
made
a
hollow
place
in
it
as
the
indians
in
brazil
make
their
canoes
after
this
i
made
a
great
heavy
pestle
or
beater
of
the
wood
called
the
iron
wood
and
this
i
prepared
and
laid
by
against
i
had
my
next
crop
of
corn
which
i
proposed
to
myself
to
grind
or
rather
pound
into
meal
to
make
bread
my
next
difficulty
was
to
make
a
sieve
or
searce
to
dress
my
meal
and
to
part
it
from
the
bran
and
the
husk
without
which
i
did
not
see
it
possible
i
could
have
any
bread
this
was
a
most
difficult
thing
even
to
think
on
for
to
be
sure
i
had
nothing
like
the
necessary
thing
to
make
it
i
mean
fine
thin
canvas
or
stuff
to
searce
the
meal
through
and
here
i
was
at
a
full
stop
for
many
months
nor
did
i
really
know
what
to
do
linen
i
had
none
left
but
what
was
mere
rags
i
had
goat
s
hair
but
neither
knew
how
to
weave
it
or
spin
it
and
had
i
known
how
here
were
no
tools
to
work
it
with
all
the
remedy
that
i
found
for
this
was
that
at
last
i
did
remember
i
had
among
the
seamen
s
clothes
which
were
saved
out
of
the
ship
some
neckcloths
of
calico
or
muslin
and
with
some
pieces
of
these
i
made
three
small
sieves
proper
enough
for
the
work
and
thus
i
made
shift
for
some
years
how
i
did
afterwards
i
shall
show
in
its
place
the
baking
part
was
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
and
how
i
should
make
bread
when
i
came
to
have
corn
for
first
i
had
no
yeast
as
to
that
part
there
was
no
supplying
the
want
so
i
did
not
concern
myself
much
about
it
but
for
an
oven
i
was
indeed
in
great
pain
at
length
i
found
out
an
experiment
for
that
also
which
was
this
i
made
some
earthen
vessels
very
broad
but
not
deep
that
is
to
say
about
two
feet
diameter
and
not
above
nine
inches
deep
these
i
burned
in
the
fire
as
i
had
done
the
other
and
laid
them
by
and
when
i
wanted
to
bake
i
made
a
great
fire
upon
my
hearth
which
i
had
paved
with
some
square
tiles
of
my
own
baking
and
burning
also
but
i
should
not
call
them
square
when
the
firewood
was
burned
pretty
much
into
embers
or
live
coals
i
drew
them
forward
upon
this
hearth
so
as
to
cover
it
all
over
and
there
i
let
them
lie
till
the
hearth
was
very
hot
then
sweeping
away
all
the
embers
i
set
down
my
loaf
or
loaves
and
whelming
down
the
earthen
pot
upon
them
drew
the
embers
all
round
the
outside
of
the
pot
to
keep
in
and
add
to
the
heat
and
thus
as
well
as
in
the
best
oven
in
the
world
i
baked
my
barley
loaves
and
became
in
little
time
a
good
pastrycook
into
the
bargain
for
i
made
myself
several
cakes
and
puddings
of
the
rice
but
i
made
no
pies
neither
had
i
anything
to
put
into
them
supposing
i
had
except
the
flesh
either
of
fowls
or
goats
it
need
not
be
wondered
at
if
all
these
things
took
me
up
most
part
of
the
third
year
of
my
abode
here
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
the
intervals
of
these
things
i
had
my
new
harvest
and
husbandry
to
manage
for
i
reaped
my
corn
in
its
season
and
carried
it
home
as
well
as
i
could
and
laid
it
up
in
the
ear
in
my
large
baskets
till
i
had
time
to
rub
it
out
for
i
had
no
floor
to
thrash
it
on
or
instrument
to
thrash
it
with
and
now
indeed
my
stock
of
corn
increasing
i
really
wanted
to
build
my
barns
bigger
i
wanted
a
place
to
lay
it
up
in
for
the
increase
of
the
corn
now
yielded
me
so
much
that
i
had
of
the
barley
about
twenty
bushels
and
of
the
rice
as
much
or
more
insomuch
that
now
i
resolved
to
begin
to
use
it
freely
for
my
bread
had
been
quite
gone
a
great
while
also
i
resolved
to
see
what
quantity
would
be
sufficient
for
me
a
whole
year
and
to
sow
but
once
a
year
upon
the
whole
i
found
that
the
forty
bushels
of
barley
and
rice
were
much
more
than
i
could
consume
in
a
year
so
i
resolved
to
sow
just
the
same
quantity
every
year
that
i
sowed
the
last
in
hopes
that
such
a
quantity
would
fully
provide
me
with
bread
c
all
the
while
these
things
were
doing
you
may
be
sure
my
thoughts
ran
many
times
upon
the
prospect
of
land
which
i
had
seen
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
i
was
not
without
secret
wishes
that
i
were
on
shore
there
fancying
that
seeing
the
mainland
and
an
inhabited
country
i
might
find
some
way
or
other
to
convey
myself
further
and
perhaps
at
last
find
some
means
of
escape
but
all
this
while
i
made
no
allowance
for
the
dangers
of
such
an
undertaking
and
how
i
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
savages
and
perhaps
such
as
i
might
have
reason
to
think
far
worse
than
the
lions
and
tigers
of
africa
that
if
i
once
came
in
their
power
i
should
run
a
hazard
of
more
than
a
thousand
to
one
of
being
killed
and
perhaps
of
being
eaten
for
i
had
heard
that
the
people
of
the
caribbean
coast
were
cannibals
or
man
eaters
and
i
knew
by
the
latitude
that
i
could
not
be
far
from
that
shore
then
supposing
they
were
not
cannibals
yet
they
might
kill
me
as
many
europeans
who
had
fallen
into
their
hands
had
been
served
even
when
they
had
been
ten
or
twenty
together
much
more
i
that
was
but
one
and
could
make
little
or
no
defence
all
these
things
i
say
which
i
ought
to
have
considered
well
and
did
come
into
my
thoughts
afterwards
yet
gave
me
no
apprehensions
at
first
and
my
head
ran
mightily
upon
the
thought
of
getting
over
to
the
shore
now
i
wished
for
my
boy
xury
and
the
long
boat
with
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
with
which
i
sailed
above
a
thousand
miles
on
the
coast
of
africa
but
this
was
in
vain
then
i
thought
i
would
go
and
look
at
our
ship
s
boat
which
as
i
have
said
was
blown
up
upon
the
shore
a
great
way
in
the
storm
when
we
were
first
cast
away
she
lay
almost
where
she
did
at
first
but
not
quite
and
was
turned
by
the
force
of
the
waves
and
the
winds
almost
bottom
upward
against
a
high
ridge
of
beachy
rough
sand
but
no
water
about
her
if
i
had
had
hands
to
have
refitted
her
and
to
have
launched
her
into
the
water
the
boat
would
have
done
well
enough
and
i
might
have
gone
back
into
the
brazils
with
her
easily
enough
but
i
might
have
foreseen
that
i
could
no
more
turn
her
and
set
her
upright
upon
her
bottom
than
i
could
remove
the
island
however
i
went
to
the
woods
and
cut
levers
and
rollers
and
brought
them
to
the
boat
resolving
to
try
what
i
could
do
suggesting
to
myself
that
if
i
could
but
turn
her
down
i
might
repair
the
damage
she
had
received
and
she
would
be
a
very
good
boat
and
i
might
go
to
sea
in
her
very
easily
i
spared
no
pains
indeed
in
this
piece
of
fruitless
toil
and
spent
i
think
three
or
four
weeks
about
it
at
last
finding
it
impossible
to
heave
it
up
with
my
little
strength
i
fell
to
digging
away
the
sand
to
undermine
it
and
so
to
make
it
fall
down
setting
pieces
of
wood
to
thrust
and
guide
it
right
in
the
fall
but
when
i
had
done
this
i
was
unable
to
stir
it
up
again
or
to
get
under
it
much
less
to
move
it
forward
towards
the
water
so
i
was
forced
to
give
it
over
and
yet
though
i
gave
over
the
hopes
of
the
boat
my
desire
to
venture
over
for
the
main
increased
rather
than
decreased
as
the
means
for
it
seemed
impossible
this
at
length
put
me
upon
thinking
whether
it
was
not
possible
to
make
myself
a
canoe
or
periagua
such
as
the
natives
of
those
climates
make
even
without
tools
or
as
i
might
say
without
hands
of
the
trunk
of
a
great
tree
this
i
not
only
thought
possible
but
easy
and
pleased
myself
extremely
with
the
thoughts
of
making
it
and
with
my
having
much
more
convenience
for
it
than
any
of
the
negroes
or
indians
but
not
at
all
considering
the
particular
inconveniences
which
i
lay
under
more
than
the
indians
did
viz
want
of
hands
to
move
it
when
it
was
made
into
the
water
a
difficulty
much
harder
for
me
to
surmount
than
all
the
consequences
of
want
of
tools
could
be
to
them
for
what
was
it
to
me
if
when
i
had
chosen
a
vast
tree
in
the
woods
and
with
much
trouble
cut
it
down
if
i
had
been
able
with
my
tools
to
hew
and
dub
the
outside
into
the
proper
shape
of
a
boat
and
burn
or
cut
out
the
inside
to
make
it
hollow
so
as
to
make
a
boat
of
it
if
after
all
this
i
must
leave
it
just
there
where
i
found
it
and
not
be
able
to
launch
it
into
the
water
one
would
have
thought
i
could
not
have
had
the
least
reflection
upon
my
mind
of
my
circumstances
while
i
was
making
this
boat
but
i
should
have
immediately
thought
how
i
should
get
it
into
the
sea
but
my
thoughts
were
so
intent
upon
my
voyage
over
the
sea
in
it
that
i
never
once
considered
how
i
should
get
it
off
the
land
and
it
was
really
in
its
own
nature
more
easy
for
me
to
guide
it
over
forty
five
miles
of
sea
than
about
forty
five
fathoms
of
land
where
it
lay
to
set
it
afloat
in
the
water
i
went
to
work
upon
this
boat
the
most
like
a
fool
that
ever
man
did
who
had
any
of
his
senses
awake
i
pleased
myself
with
the
design
without
determining
whether
i
was
ever
able
to
undertake
it
not
but
that
the
difficulty
of
launching
my
boat
came
often
into
my
head
but
i
put
a
stop
to
my
inquiries
into
it
by
this
foolish
answer
which
i
gave
myself
let
me
first
make
it
i
warrant
i
will
find
some
way
or
other
to
get
it
along
when
it
is
done
this
was
a
most
preposterous
method
but
the
eagerness
of
my
fancy
prevailed
and
to
work
i
went
i
felled
a
cedar
tree
and
i
question
much
whether
solomon
ever
had
such
a
one
for
the
building
of
the
temple
of
jerusalem
it
was
five
feet
ten
inches
diameter
at
the
lower
part
next
the
stump
and
four
feet
eleven
inches
diameter
at
the
end
of
twenty
two
feet
after
which
it
lessened
for
a
while
and
then
parted
into
branches
it
was
not
without
infinite
labour
that
i
felled
this
tree
i
was
twenty
days
hacking
and
hewing
at
it
at
the
bottom
i
was
fourteen
more
getting
the
branches
and
limbs
and
the
vast
spreading
head
cut
off
which
i
hacked
and
hewed
through
with
axe
and
hatchet
and
inexpressible
labour
after
this
it
cost
me
a
month
to
shape
it
and
dub
it
to
a
proportion
and
to
something
like
the
bottom
of
a
boat
that
it
might
swim
upright
as
it
ought
to
do
it
cost
me
near
three
months
more
to
clear
the
inside
and
work
it
out
so
as
to
make
an
exact
boat
of
it
this
i
did
indeed
without
fire
by
mere
mallet
and
chisel
and
by
the
dint
of
hard
labour
till
i
had
brought
it
to
be
a
very
handsome
periagua
and
big
enough
to
have
carried
six
and
twenty
men
and
consequently
big
enough
to
have
carried
me
and
all
my
cargo
when
i
had
gone
through
this
work
i
was
extremely
delighted
with
it
the
boat
was
really
much
bigger
than
ever
i
saw
a
canoe
or
periagua
that
was
made
of
one
tree
in
my
life
many
a
weary
stroke
it
had
cost
you
may
be
sure
and
had
i
gotten
it
into
the
water
i
make
no
question
but
i
should
have
begun
the
maddest
voyage
and
the
most
unlikely
to
be
performed
that
ever
was
undertaken
but
all
my
devices
to
get
it
into
the
water
failed
me
though
they
cost
me
infinite
labour
too
it
lay
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
water
and
not
more
but
the
first
inconvenience
was
it
was
up
hill
towards
the
creek
well
to
take
away
this
discouragement
i
resolved
to
dig
into
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
so
make
a
declivity
this
i
began
and
it
cost
me
a
prodigious
deal
of
pains
but
who
grudge
pains
who
have
their
deliverance
in
view
but
when
this
was
worked
through
and
this
difficulty
managed
it
was
still
much
the
same
for
i
could
no
more
stir
the
canoe
than
i
could
the
other
boat
then
i
measured
the
distance
of
ground
and
resolved
to
cut
a
dock
or
canal
to
bring
the
water
up
to
the
canoe
seeing
i
could
not
bring
the
canoe
down
to
the
water
well
i
began
this
work
and
when
i
began
to
enter
upon
it
and
calculate
how
deep
it
was
to
be
dug
how
broad
how
the
stuff
was
to
be
thrown
out
i
found
that
by
the
number
of
hands
i
had
being
none
but
my
own
it
must
have
been
ten
or
twelve
years
before
i
could
have
gone
through
with
it
for
the
shore
lay
so
high
that
at
the
upper
end
it
must
have
been
at
least
twenty
feet
deep
so
at
length
though
with
great
reluctancy
i
gave
this
attempt
over
also
this
grieved
me
heartily
and
now
i
saw
though
too
late
the
folly
of
beginning
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
in
the
middle
of
this
work
i
finished
my
fourth
year
in
this
place
and
kept
my
anniversary
with
the
same
devotion
and
with
as
much
comfort
as
ever
before
for
by
a
constant
study
and
serious
application
to
the
word
of
god
and
by
the
assistance
of
his
grace
i
gained
a
different
knowledge
from
what
i
had
before
i
entertained
different
notions
of
things
i
looked
now
upon
the
world
as
a
thing
remote
which
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
no
expectations
from
and
indeed
no
desires
about
in
a
word
i
had
nothing
indeed
to
do
with
it
nor
was
ever
likely
to
have
so
i
thought
it
looked
as
we
may
perhaps
look
upon
it
hereafter
viz
as
a
place
i
had
lived
in
but
was
come
out
of
it
and
well
might
i
say
as
father
abraham
to
dives
between
me
and
thee
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
in
the
first
place
i
was
removed
from
all
the
wickedness
of
the
world
here
i
had
neither
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
the
lusts
of
the
eye
nor
the
pride
of
life
i
had
nothing
to
covet
for
i
had
all
that
i
was
now
capable
of
enjoying
i
was
lord
of
the
whole
manor
or
if
i
pleased
i
might
call
myself
king
or
emperor
over
the
whole
country
which
i
had
possession
of
there
were
no
rivals
i
had
no
competitor
none
to
dispute
sovereignty
or
command
with
me
i
might
have
raised
ship
loadings
of
corn
but
i
had
no
use
for
it
so
i
let
as
little
grow
as
i
thought
enough
for
my
occasion
i
had
tortoise
or
turtle
enough
but
now
and
then
one
was
as
much
as
i
could
put
to
any
use
i
had
timber
enough
to
have
built
a
fleet
of
ships
and
i
had
grapes
enough
to
have
made
wine
or
to
have
cured
into
raisins
to
have
loaded
that
fleet
when
it
had
been
built
but
all
i
could
make
use
of
was
all
that
was
valuable
i
had
enough
to
eat
and
supply
my
wants
and
what
was
all
the
rest
to
me
if
i
killed
more
flesh
than
i
could
eat
the
dog
must
eat
it
or
vermin
if
i
sowed
more
corn
than
i
could
eat
it
must
be
spoiled
the
trees
that
i
cut
down
were
lying
to
rot
on
the
ground
i
could
make
no
more
use
of
them
but
for
fuel
and
that
i
had
no
occasion
for
but
to
dress
my
food
in
a
word
the
nature
and
experience
of
things
dictated
to
me
upon
just
reflection
that
all
the
good
things
of
this
world
are
no
farther
good
to
us
than
they
are
for
our
use
and
that
whatever
we
may
heap
up
to
give
others
we
enjoy
just
as
much
as
we
can
use
and
no
more
the
most
covetous
griping
miser
in
the
world
would
have
been
cured
of
the
vice
of
covetousness
if
he
had
been
in
my
case
for
i
possessed
infinitely
more
than
i
knew
what
to
do
with
i
had
no
room
for
desire
except
it
was
of
things
which
i
had
not
and
they
were
but
trifles
though
indeed
of
great
use
to
me
i
had
as
i
hinted
before
a
parcel
of
money
as
well
gold
as
silver
about
thirty
six
pounds
sterling
alas
there
the
sorry
useless
stuff
lay
i
had
no
more
manner
of
business
for
it
and
often
thought
with
myself
that
i
would
have
given
a
handful
of
it
for
a
gross
of
tobacco
pipes
or
for
a
hand
mill
to
grind
my
corn
nay
i
would
have
given
it
all
for
a
sixpenny
worth
of
turnip
and
carrot
seed
out
of
england
or
for
a
handful
of
peas
and
beans
and
a
bottle
of
ink
as
it
was
i
had
not
the
least
advantage
by
it
or
benefit
from
it
but
there
it
lay
in
a
drawer
and
grew
mouldy
with
the
damp
of
the
cave
in
the
wet
seasons
and
if
i
had
had
the
drawer
full
of
diamonds
it
had
been
the
same
case
they
had
been
of
no
manner
of
value
to
me
because
of
no
use
i
had
now
brought
my
state
of
life
to
be
much
easier
in
itself
than
it
was
at
first
and
much
easier
to
my
mind
as
well
as
to
my
body
i
frequently
sat
down
to
meat
with
thankfulness
and
admired
the
hand
of
god
s
providence
which
had
thus
spread
my
table
in
the
wilderness
i
learned
to
look
more
upon
the
bright
side
of
my
condition
and
less
upon
the
dark
side
and
to
consider
what
i
enjoyed
rather
than
what
i
wanted
and
this
gave
me
sometimes
such
secret
comforts
that
i
cannot
express
them
and
which
i
take
notice
of
here
to
put
those
discontented
people
in
mind
of
it
who
cannot
enjoy
comfortably
what
god
has
given
them
because
they
see
and
covet
something
that
he
has
not
given
them
all
our
discontents
about
what
we
want
appeared
to
me
to
spring
from
the
want
of
thankfulness
for
what
we
have
another
reflection
was
of
great
use
to
me
and
doubtless
would
be
so
to
any
one
that
should
fall
into
such
distress
as
mine
was
and
this
was
to
compare
my
present
condition
with
what
i
at
first
expected
it
would
be
nay
with
what
it
would
certainly
have
been
if
the
good
providence
of
god
had
not
wonderfully
ordered
the
ship
to
be
cast
up
nearer
to
the
shore
where
i
not
only
could
come
at
her
but
could
bring
what
i
got
out
of
her
to
the
shore
for
my
relief
and
comfort
without
which
i
had
wanted
for
tools
to
work
weapons
for
defence
and
gunpowder
and
shot
for
getting
my
food
i
spent
whole
hours
i
may
say
whole
days
in
representing
to
myself
in
the
most
lively
colours
how
i
must
have
acted
if
i
had
got
nothing
out
of
the
ship
how
i
could
not
have
so
much
as
got
any
food
except
fish
and
turtles
and
that
as
it
was
long
before
i
found
any
of
them
i
must
have
perished
first
that
i
should
have
lived
if
i
had
not
perished
like
a
mere
savage
that
if
i
had
killed
a
goat
or
a
fowl
by
any
contrivance
i
had
no
way
to
flay
or
open
it
or
part
the
flesh
from
the
skin
and
the
bowels
or
to
cut
it
up
but
must
gnaw
it
with
my
teeth
and
pull
it
with
my
claws
like
a
beast
these
reflections
made
me
very
sensible
of
the
goodness
of
providence
to
me
and
very
thankful
for
my
present
condition
with
all
its
hardships
and
misfortunes
and
this
part
also
i
cannot
but
recommend
to
the
reflection
of
those
who
are
apt
in
their
misery
to
say
is
any
affliction
like
mine
let
them
consider
how
much
worse
the
cases
of
some
people
are
and
their
case
might
have
been
if
providence
had
thought
fit
i
had
another
reflection
which
assisted
me
also
to
comfort
my
mind
with
hopes
and
this
was
comparing
my
present
situation
with
what
i
had
deserved
and
had
therefore
reason
to
expect
from
the
hand
of
providence
i
had
lived
a
dreadful
life
perfectly
destitute
of
the
knowledge
and
fear
of
god
i
had
been
well
instructed
by
father
and
mother
neither
had
they
been
wanting
to
me
in
their
early
endeavours
to
infuse
a
religious
awe
of
god
into
my
mind
a
sense
of
my
duty
and
what
the
nature
and
end
of
my
being
required
of
me
but
alas
falling
early
into
the
seafaring
life
which
of
all
lives
is
the
most
destitute
of
the
fear
of
god
though
his
terrors
are
always
before
them
i
say
falling
early
into
the
seafaring
life
and
into
seafaring
company
all
that
little
sense
of
religion
which
i
had
entertained
was
laughed
out
of
me
by
my
messmates
by
a
hardened
despising
of
dangers
and
the
views
of
death
which
grew
habitual
to
me
by
my
long
absence
from
all
manner
of
opportunities
to
converse
with
anything
but
what
was
like
myself
or
to
hear
anything
that
was
good
or
tended
towards
it
so
void
was
i
of
everything
that
was
good
or
the
least
sense
of
what
i
was
or
was
to
be
that
in
the
greatest
deliverances
i
enjoyed
such
as
my
escape
from
sallee
my
being
taken
up
by
the
portuguese
master
of
the
ship
my
being
planted
so
well
in
the
brazils
my
receiving
the
cargo
from
england
and
the
like
i
never
had
once
the
words
thank
god
so
much
as
on
my
mind
or
in
my
mouth
nor
in
the
greatest
distress
had
i
so
much
as
a
thought
to
pray
to
him
or
so
much
as
to
say
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
no
nor
to
mention
the
name
of
god
unless
it
was
to
swear
by
and
blaspheme
it
i
had
terrible
reflections
upon
my
mind
for
many
months
as
i
have
already
observed
on
account
of
my
wicked
and
hardened
life
past
and
when
i
looked
about
me
and
considered
what
particular
providences
had
attended
me
since
my
coming
into
this
place
and
how
god
had
dealt
bountifully
with
me
had
not
only
punished
me
less
than
my
iniquity
had
deserved
but
had
so
plentifully
provided
for
me
this
gave
me
great
hopes
that
my
repentance
was
accepted
and
that
god
had
yet
mercy
in
store
for
me
with
these
reflections
i
worked
my
mind
up
not
only
to
a
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
in
the
present
disposition
of
my
circumstances
but
even
to
a
sincere
thankfulness
for
my
condition
and
that
i
who
was
yet
a
living
man
ought
not
to
complain
seeing
i
had
not
the
due
punishment
of
my
sins
that
i
enjoyed
so
many
mercies
which
i
had
no
reason
to
have
expected
in
that
place
that
i
ought
never
more
to
repine
at
my
condition
but
to
rejoice
and
to
give
daily
thanks
for
that
daily
bread
which
nothing
but
a
crowd
of
wonders
could
have
brought
that
i
ought
to
consider
i
had
been
fed
even
by
a
miracle
even
as
great
as
that
of
feeding
elijah
by
ravens
nay
by
a
long
series
of
miracles
and
that
i
could
hardly
have
named
a
place
in
the
uninhabitable
part
of
the
world
where
i
could
have
been
cast
more
to
my
advantage
a
place
where
as
i
had
no
society
which
was
my
affliction
on
one
hand
so
i
found
no
ravenous
beasts
no
furious
wolves
or
tigers
to
threaten
my
life
no
venomous
creatures
or
poisons
which
i
might
feed
on
to
my
hurt
no
savages
to
murder
and
devour
me
in
a
word
as
my
life
was
a
life
of
sorrow
one
way
so
it
was
a
life
of
mercy
another
and
i
wanted
nothing
to
make
it
a
life
of
comfort
but
to
be
able
to
make
my
sense
of
god
s
goodness
to
me
and
care
over
me
in
this
condition
be
my
daily
consolation
and
after
i
did
make
a
just
improvement
on
these
things
i
went
away
and
was
no
more
sad
i
had
now
been
here
so
long
that
many
things
which
i
had
brought
on
shore
for
my
help
were
either
quite
gone
or
very
much
wasted
and
near
spent
my
ink
as
i
observed
had
been
gone
some
time
all
but
a
very
little
which
i
eked
out
with
water
a
little
and
a
little
till
it
was
so
pale
it
scarce
left
any
appearance
of
black
upon
the
paper
as
long
as
it
lasted
i
made
use
of
it
to
minute
down
the
days
of
the
month
on
which
any
remarkable
thing
happened
to
me
and
first
by
casting
up
times
past
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
strange
concurrence
of
days
in
the
various
providences
which
befell
me
and
which
if
i
had
been
superstitiously
inclined
to
observe
days
as
fatal
or
fortunate
i
might
have
had
reason
to
have
looked
upon
with
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
first
i
had
observed
that
the
same
day
that
i
broke
away
from
my
father
and
friends
and
ran
away
to
hull
in
order
to
go
to
sea
the
same
day
afterwards
i
was
taken
by
the
sallee
man
of
war
and
made
a
slave
the
same
day
of
the
year
that
i
escaped
out
of
the
wreck
of
that
ship
in
yarmouth
roads
that
same
day
year
afterwards
i
made
my
escape
from
sallee
in
a
boat
the
same
day
of
the
year
i
was
born
on
viz
the
th
of
september
that
same
day
i
had
my
life
so
miraculously
saved
twenty
six
years
after
when
i
was
cast
on
shore
in
this
island
so
that
my
wicked
life
and
my
solitary
life
began
both
on
a
day
the
next
thing
to
my
ink
being
wasted
was
that
of
my
bread
i
mean
the
biscuit
which
i
brought
out
of
the
ship
this
i
had
husbanded
to
the
last
degree
allowing
myself
but
one
cake
of
bread
a
day
for
above
a
year
and
yet
i
was
quite
without
bread
for
near
a
year
before
i
got
any
corn
of
my
own
and
great
reason
i
had
to
be
thankful
that
i
had
any
at
all
the
getting
it
being
as
has
been
already
observed
next
to
miraculous
my
clothes
too
began
to
decay
as
to
linen
i
had
had
none
a
good
while
except
some
chequered
shirts
which
i
found
in
the
chests
of
the
other
seamen
and
which
i
carefully
preserved
because
many
times
i
could
bear
no
other
clothes
on
but
a
shirt
and
it
was
a
very
great
help
to
me
that
i
had
among
all
the
men
s
clothes
of
the
ship
almost
three
dozen
of
shirts
there
were
also
indeed
several
thick
watch
coats
of
the
seamen
s
which
were
left
but
they
were
too
hot
to
wear
and
though
it
is
true
that
the
weather
was
so
violently
hot
that
there
was
no
need
of
clothes
yet
i
could
not
go
quite
naked
no
though
i
had
been
inclined
to
it
which
i
was
not
nor
could
i
abide
the
thought
of
it
though
i
was
alone
the
reason
why
i
could
not
go
naked
was
i
could
not
bear
the
heat
of
the
sun
so
well
when
quite
naked
as
with
some
clothes
on
nay
the
very
heat
frequently
blistered
my
skin
whereas
with
a
shirt
on
the
air
itself
made
some
motion
and
whistling
under
the
shirt
was
twofold
cooler
than
without
it
no
more
could
i
ever
bring
myself
to
go
out
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
without
a
cap
or
a
hat
the
heat
of
the
sun
beating
with
such
violence
as
it
does
in
that
place
would
give
me
the
headache
presently
by
darting
so
directly
on
my
head
without
a
cap
or
hat
on
so
that
i
could
not
bear
it
whereas
if
i
put
on
my
hat
it
would
presently
go
away
upon
these
views
i
began
to
consider
about
putting
the
few
rags
i
had
which
i
called
clothes
into
some
order
i
had
worn
out
all
the
waistcoats
i
had
and
my
business
was
now
to
try
if
i
could
not
make
jackets
out
of
the
great
watch
coats
which
i
had
by
me
and
with
such
other
materials
as
i
had
so
i
set
to
work
tailoring
or
rather
indeed
botching
for
i
made
most
piteous
work
of
it
however
i
made
shift
to
make
two
or
three
new
waistcoats
which
i
hoped
would
serve
me
a
great
while
as
for
breeches
or
drawers
i
made
but
a
very
sorry
shift
indeed
till
afterwards
i
have
mentioned
that
i
saved
the
skins
of
all
the
creatures
that
i
killed
i
mean
four
footed
ones
and
i
had
them
hung
up
stretched
out
with
sticks
in
the
sun
by
which
means
some
of
them
were
so
dry
and
hard
that
they
were
fit
for
little
but
others
were
very
useful
the
first
thing
i
made
of
these
was
a
great
cap
for
my
head
with
the
hair
on
the
outside
to
shoot
off
the
rain
and
this
i
performed
so
well
that
after
i
made
me
a
suit
of
clothes
wholly
of
these
skins
that
is
to
say
a
waistcoat
and
breeches
open
at
the
knees
and
both
loose
for
they
were
rather
wanting
to
keep
me
cool
than
to
keep
me
warm
i
must
not
omit
to
acknowledge
that
they
were
wretchedly
made
for
if
i
was
a
bad
carpenter
i
was
a
worse
tailor
however
they
were
such
as
i
made
very
good
shift
with
and
when
i
was
out
if
it
happened
to
rain
the
hair
of
my
waistcoat
and
cap
being
outermost
i
was
kept
very
dry
after
this
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
pains
to
make
an
umbrella
i
was
indeed
in
great
want
of
one
and
had
a
great
mind
to
make
one
i
had
seen
them
made
in
the
brazils
where
they
are
very
useful
in
the
great
heats
there
and
i
felt
the
heats
every
jot
as
great
here
and
greater
too
being
nearer
the
equinox
besides
as
i
was
obliged
to
be
much
abroad
it
was
a
most
useful
thing
to
me
as
well
for
the
rains
as
the
heats
i
took
a
world
of
pains
with
it
and
was
a
great
while
before
i
could
make
anything
likely
to
hold
nay
after
i
had
thought
i
had
hit
the
way
i
spoiled
two
or
three
before
i
made
one
to
my
mind
but
at
last
i
made
one
that
answered
indifferently
well
the
main
difficulty
i
found
was
to
make
it
let
down
i
could
make
it
spread
but
if
it
did
not
let
down
too
and
draw
in
it
was
not
portable
for
me
any
way
but
just
over
my
head
which
would
not
do
however
at
last
as
i
said
i
made
one
to
answer
and
covered
it
with
skins
the
hair
upwards
so
that
it
cast
off
the
rain
like
a
pent
house
and
kept
off
the
sun
so
effectually
that
i
could
walk
out
in
the
hottest
of
the
weather
with
greater
advantage
than
i
could
before
in
the
coolest
and
when
i
had
no
need
of
it
could
close
it
and
carry
it
under
my
arm
thus
i
lived
mighty
comfortably
my
mind
being
entirely
composed
by
resigning
myself
to
the
will
of
god
and
throwing
myself
wholly
upon
the
disposal
of
his
providence
this
made
my
life
better
than
sociable
for
when
i
began
to
regret
the
want
of
conversation
i
would
ask
myself
whether
thus
conversing
mutually
with
my
own
thoughts
and
as
i
hope
i
may
say
with
even
god
himself
by
ejaculations
was
not
better
than
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
human
society
in
the
world
chapter
x
tames
goats
i
cannot
say
that
after
this
for
five
years
any
extraordinary
thing
happened
to
me
but
i
lived
on
in
the
same
course
in
the
same
posture
and
place
as
before
the
chief
things
i
was
employed
in
besides
my
yearly
labour
of
planting
my
barley
and
rice
and
curing
my
raisins
of
both
which
i
always
kept
up
just
enough
to
have
sufficient
stock
of
one
year
s
provisions
beforehand
i
say
besides
this
yearly
labour
and
my
daily
pursuit
of
going
out
with
my
gun
i
had
one
labour
to
make
a
canoe
which
at
last
i
finished
so
that
by
digging
a
canal
to
it
of
six
feet
wide
and
four
feet
deep
i
brought
it
into
the
creek
almost
half
a
mile
as
for
the
first
which
was
so
vastly
big
for
i
made
it
without
considering
beforehand
as
i
ought
to
have
done
how
i
should
be
able
to
launch
it
so
never
being
able
to
bring
it
into
the
water
or
bring
the
water
to
it
i
was
obliged
to
let
it
lie
where
it
was
as
a
memorandum
to
teach
me
to
be
wiser
the
next
time
indeed
the
next
time
though
i
could
not
get
a
tree
proper
for
it
and
was
in
a
place
where
i
could
not
get
the
water
to
it
at
any
less
distance
than
as
i
have
said
near
half
a
mile
yet
as
i
saw
it
was
practicable
at
last
i
never
gave
it
over
and
though
i
was
near
two
years
about
it
yet
i
never
grudged
my
labour
in
hopes
of
having
a
boat
to
go
off
to
sea
at
last
however
though
my
little
periagua
was
finished
yet
the
size
of
it
was
not
at
all
answerable
to
the
design
which
i
had
in
view
when
i
made
the
first
i
mean
of
venturing
over
to
the
terra
firma
where
it
was
above
forty
miles
broad
accordingly
the
smallness
of
my
boat
assisted
to
put
an
end
to
that
design
and
now
i
thought
no
more
of
it
as
i
had
a
boat
my
next
design
was
to
make
a
cruise
round
the
island
for
as
i
had
been
on
the
other
side
in
one
place
crossing
as
i
have
already
described
it
over
the
land
so
the
discoveries
i
made
in
that
little
journey
made
me
very
eager
to
see
other
parts
of
the
coast
and
now
i
had
a
boat
i
thought
of
nothing
but
sailing
round
the
island
for
this
purpose
that
i
might
do
everything
with
discretion
and
consideration
i
fitted
up
a
little
mast
in
my
boat
and
made
a
sail
too
out
of
some
of
the
pieces
of
the
ship
s
sails
which
lay
in
store
and
of
which
i
had
a
great
stock
by
me
having
fitted
my
mast
and
sail
and
tried
the
boat
i
found
she
would
sail
very
well
then
i
made
little
lockers
or
boxes
at
each
end
of
my
boat
to
put
provisions
necessaries
ammunition
c
into
to
be
kept
dry
either
from
rain
or
the
spray
of
the
sea
and
a
little
long
hollow
place
i
cut
in
the
inside
of
the
boat
where
i
could
lay
my
gun
making
a
flap
to
hang
down
over
it
to
keep
it
dry
i
fixed
my
umbrella
also
in
the
step
at
the
stern
like
a
mast
to
stand
over
my
head
and
keep
the
heat
of
the
sun
off
me
like
an
awning
and
thus
i
every
now
and
then
took
a
little
voyage
upon
the
sea
but
never
went
far
out
nor
far
from
the
little
creek
at
last
being
eager
to
view
the
circumference
of
my
little
kingdom
i
resolved
upon
my
cruise
and
accordingly
i
victualled
my
ship
for
the
voyage
putting
in
two
dozen
of
loaves
cakes
i
should
call
them
of
barley
bread
an
earthen
pot
full
of
parched
rice
a
food
i
ate
a
good
deal
of
a
little
bottle
of
rum
half
a
goat
and
powder
and
shot
for
killing
more
and
two
large
watch
coats
of
those
which
as
i
mentioned
before
i
had
saved
out
of
the
seamen
s
chests
these
i
took
one
to
lie
upon
and
the
other
to
cover
me
in
the
night
it
was
the
th
of
november
in
the
sixth
year
of
my
reign
or
my
captivity
which
you
please
that
i
set
out
on
this
voyage
and
i
found
it
much
longer
than
i
expected
for
though
the
island
itself
was
not
very
large
yet
when
i
came
to
the
east
side
of
it
i
found
a
great
ledge
of
rocks
lie
out
about
two
leagues
into
the
sea
some
above
water
some
under
it
and
beyond
that
a
shoal
of
sand
lying
dry
half
a
league
more
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
to
double
the
point
when
i
first
discovered
them
i
was
going
to
give
over
my
enterprise
and
come
back
again
not
knowing
how
far
it
might
oblige
me
to
go
out
to
sea
and
above
all
doubting
how
i
should
get
back
again
so
i
came
to
an
anchor
for
i
had
made
a
kind
of
an
anchor
with
a
piece
of
a
broken
grappling
which
i
got
out
of
the
ship
having
secured
my
boat
i
took
my
gun
and
went
on
shore
climbing
up
a
hill
which
seemed
to
overlook
that
point
where
i
saw
the
full
extent
of
it
and
resolved
to
venture
in
my
viewing
the
sea
from
that
hill
where
i
stood
i
perceived
a
strong
and
indeed
a
most
furious
current
which
ran
to
the
east
and
even
came
close
to
the
point
and
i
took
the
more
notice
of
it
because
i
saw
there
might
be
some
danger
that
when
i
came
into
it
i
might
be
carried
out
to
sea
by
the
strength
of
it
and
not
be
able
to
make
the
island
again
and
indeed
had
i
not
got
first
upon
this
hill
i
believe
it
would
have
been
so
for
there
was
the
same
current
on
the
other
side
the
island
only
that
it
set
off
at
a
further
distance
and
i
saw
there
was
a
strong
eddy
under
the
shore
so
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
out
of
the
first
current
and
i
should
presently
be
in
an
eddy
i
lay
here
however
two
days
because
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fresh
at
ese
and
that
being
just
contrary
to
the
current
made
a
great
breach
of
the
sea
upon
the
point
so
that
it
was
not
safe
for
me
to
keep
too
close
to
the
shore
for
the
breach
nor
to
go
too
far
off
because
of
the
stream
the
third
day
in
the
morning
the
wind
having
abated
overnight
the
sea
was
calm
and
i
ventured
but
i
am
a
warning
to
all
rash
and
ignorant
pilots
for
no
sooner
was
i
come
to
the
point
when
i
was
not
even
my
boat
s
length
from
the
shore
but
i
found
myself
in
a
great
depth
of
water
and
a
current
like
the
sluice
of
a
mill
it
carried
my
boat
along
with
it
with
such
violence
that
all
i
could
do
could
not
keep
her
so
much
as
on
the
edge
of
it
but
i
found
it
hurried
me
farther
and
farther
out
from
the
eddy
which
was
on
my
left
hand
there
was
no
wind
stirring
to
help
me
and
all
i
could
do
with
my
paddles
signified
nothing
and
now
i
began
to
give
myself
over
for
lost
for
as
the
current
was
on
both
sides
of
the
island
i
knew
in
a
few
leagues
distance
they
must
join
again
and
then
i
was
irrecoverably
gone
nor
did
i
see
any
possibility
of
avoiding
it
so
that
i
had
no
prospect
before
me
but
of
perishing
not
by
the
sea
for
that
was
calm
enough
but
of
starving
from
hunger
i
had
indeed
found
a
tortoise
on
the
shore
as
big
almost
as
i
could
lift
and
had
tossed
it
into
the
boat
and
i
had
a
great
jar
of
fresh
water
that
is
to
say
one
of
my
earthen
pots
but
what
was
all
this
to
being
driven
into
the
vast
ocean
where
to
be
sure
there
was
no
shore
no
mainland
or
island
for
a
thousand
leagues
at
least
and
now
i
saw
how
easy
it
was
for
the
providence
of
god
to
make
even
the
most
miserable
condition
of
mankind
worse
now
i
looked
back
upon
my
desolate
solitary
island
as
the
most
pleasant
place
in
the
world
and
all
the
happiness
my
heart
could
wish
for
was
to
be
but
there
again
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
it
with
eager
wishes
o
happy
desert
said
i
i
shall
never
see
thee
more
o
miserable
creature
whither
am
going
then
i
reproached
myself
with
my
unthankful
temper
and
that
i
had
repined
at
my
solitary
condition
and
now
what
would
i
give
to
be
on
shore
there
again
thus
we
never
see
the
true
state
of
our
condition
till
it
is
illustrated
to
us
by
its
contraries
nor
know
how
to
value
what
we
enjoy
but
by
the
want
of
it
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
the
consternation
i
was
now
in
being
driven
from
my
beloved
island
for
so
it
appeared
to
me
now
to
be
into
the
wide
ocean
almost
two
leagues
and
in
the
utmost
despair
of
ever
recovering
it
again
however
i
worked
hard
till
indeed
my
strength
was
almost
exhausted
and
kept
my
boat
as
much
to
the
northward
that
is
towards
the
side
of
the
current
which
the
eddy
lay
on
as
possibly
i
could
when
about
noon
as
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
i
thought
i
felt
a
little
breeze
of
wind
in
my
face
springing
up
from
sse
this
cheered
my
heart
a
little
and
especially
when
in
about
half
an
hour
more
it
blew
a
pretty
gentle
gale
by
this
time
i
had
got
at
a
frightful
distance
from
the
island
and
had
the
least
cloudy
or
hazy
weather
intervened
i
had
been
undone
another
way
too
for
i
had
no
compass
on
board
and
should
never
have
known
how
to
have
steered
towards
the
island
if
i
had
but
once
lost
sight
of
it
but
the
weather
continuing
clear
i
applied
myself
to
get
up
my
mast
again
and
spread
my
sail
standing
away
to
the
north
as
much
as
possible
to
get
out
of
the
current
just
as
i
had
set
my
mast
and
sail
and
the
boat
began
to
stretch
away
i
saw
even
by
the
clearness
of
the
water
some
alteration
of
the
current
was
near
for
where
the
current
was
so
strong
the
water
was
foul
but
perceiving
the
water
clear
i
found
the
current
abate
and
presently
i
found
to
the
east
at
about
half
a
mile
a
breach
of
the
sea
upon
some
rocks
these
rocks
i
found
caused
the
current
to
part
again
and
as
the
main
stress
of
it
ran
away
more
southerly
leaving
the
rocks
to
the
north
east
so
the
other
returned
by
the
repulse
of
the
rocks
and
made
a
strong
eddy
which
ran
back
again
to
the
north
west
with
a
very
sharp
stream
they
who
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
reprieve
brought
to
them
upon
the
ladder
or
to
be
rescued
from
thieves
just
going
to
murder
them
or
who
have
been
in
such
extremities
may
guess
what
my
present
surprise
of
joy
was
and
how
gladly
i
put
my
boat
into
the
stream
of
this
eddy
and
the
wind
also
freshening
how
gladly
i
spread
my
sail
to
it
running
cheerfully
before
the
wind
and
with
a
strong
tide
or
eddy
underfoot
this
eddy
carried
me
about
a
league
on
my
way
back
again
directly
towards
the
island
but
about
two
leagues
more
to
the
northward
than
the
current
which
carried
me
away
at
first
so
that
when
i
came
near
the
island
i
found
myself
open
to
the
northern
shore
of
it
that
is
to
say
the
other
end
of
the
island
opposite
to
that
which
i
went
out
from
when
i
had
made
something
more
than
a
league
of
way
by
the
help
of
this
current
or
eddy
i
found
it
was
spent
and
served
me
no
further
however
i
found
that
being
between
two
great
currents
viz
that
on
the
south
side
which
had
hurried
me
away
and
that
on
the
north
which
lay
about
a
league
on
the
other
side
i
say
between
these
two
in
the
wake
of
the
island
i
found
the
water
at
least
still
and
running
no
way
and
having
still
a
breeze
of
wind
fair
for
me
i
kept
on
steering
directly
for
the
island
though
not
making
such
fresh
way
as
i
did
before
about
four
o
clock
in
the
evening
being
then
within
a
league
of
the
island
i
found
the
point
of
the
rocks
which
occasioned
this
disaster
stretching
out
as
is
described
before
to
the
southward
and
casting
off
the
current
more
southerly
had
of
course
made
another
eddy
to
the
north
and
this
i
found
very
strong
but
not
directly
setting
the
way
my
course
lay
which
was
due
west
but
almost
full
north
however
having
a
fresh
gale
i
stretched
across
this
eddy
slanting
north
west
and
in
about
an
hour
came
within
about
a
mile
of
the
shore
where
it
being
smooth
water
i
soon
got
to
land
when
i
was
on
shore
god
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
gave
god
thanks
for
my
deliverance
resolving
to
lay
aside
all
thoughts
of
my
deliverance
by
my
boat
and
refreshing
myself
with
such
things
as
i
had
i
brought
my
boat
close
to
the
shore
in
a
little
cove
that
i
had
spied
under
some
trees
and
laid
me
down
to
sleep
being
quite
spent
with
the
labour
and
fatigue
of
the
voyage
i
was
now
at
a
great
loss
which
way
to
get
home
with
my
boat
i
had
run
so
much
hazard
and
knew
too
much
of
the
case
to
think
of
attempting
it
by
the
way
i
went
out
and
what
might
be
at
the
other
side
i
mean
the
west
side
i
knew
not
nor
had
i
any
mind
to
run
any
more
ventures
so
i
resolved
on
the
next
morning
to
make
my
way
westward
along
the
shore
and
to
see
if
there
was
no
creek
where
i
might
lay
up
my
frigate
in
safety
so
as
to
have
her
again
if
i
wanted
her
in
about
three
miles
or
thereabouts
coasting
the
shore
i
came
to
a
very
good
inlet
or
bay
about
a
mile
over
which
narrowed
till
it
came
to
a
very
little
rivulet
or
brook
where
i
found
a
very
convenient
harbour
for
my
boat
and
where
she
lay
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
little
dock
made
on
purpose
for
her
here
i
put
in
and
having
stowed
my
boat
very
safe
i
went
on
shore
to
look
about
me
and
see
where
i
was
i
soon
found
i
had
but
a
little
passed
by
the
place
where
i
had
been
before
when
i
travelled
on
foot
to
that
shore
so
taking
nothing
out
of
my
boat
but
my
gun
and
umbrella
for
it
was
exceedingly
hot
i
began
my
march
the
way
was
comfortable
enough
after
such
a
voyage
as
i
had
been
upon
and
i
reached
my
old
bower
in
the
evening
where
i
found
everything
standing
as
i
left
it
for
i
always
kept
it
in
good
order
being
as
i
said
before
my
country
house
i
got
over
the
fence
and
laid
me
down
in
the
shade
to
rest
my
limbs
for
i
was
very
weary
and
fell
asleep
but
judge
you
if
you
can
that
read
my
story
what
a
surprise
i
must
be
in
when
i
was
awaked
out
of
my
sleep
by
a
voice
calling
me
by
my
name
several
times
robin
robin
robin
crusoe
poor
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
where
have
you
been
i
was
so
dead
asleep
at
first
being
fatigued
with
rowing
or
part
of
the
day
and
with
walking
the
latter
part
that
i
did
not
wake
thoroughly
but
dozing
thought
i
dreamed
that
somebody
spoke
to
me
but
as
the
voice
continued
to
repeat
robin
crusoe
robin
crusoe
at
last
i
began
to
wake
more
perfectly
and
was
at
first
dreadfully
frightened
and
started
up
in
the
utmost
consternation
but
no
sooner
were
my
eyes
open
but
i
saw
my
poll
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
hedge
and
immediately
knew
that
it
was
he
that
spoke
to
me
for
just
in
such
bemoaning
language
i
had
used
to
talk
to
him
and
teach
him
and
he
had
learned
it
so
perfectly
that
he
would
sit
upon
my
finger
and
lay
his
bill
close
to
my
face
and
cry
poor
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
where
have
you
been
how
came
you
here
and
such
things
as
i
had
taught
him
however
even
though
i
knew
it
was
the
parrot
and
that
indeed
it
could
be
nobody
else
it
was
a
good
while
before
i
could
compose
myself
first
i
was
amazed
how
the
creature
got
thither
and
then
how
he
should
just
keep
about
the
place
and
nowhere
else
but
as
i
was
well
satisfied
it
could
be
nobody
but
honest
poll
i
got
over
it
and
holding
out
my
hand
and
calling
him
by
his
name
poll
the
sociable
creature
came
to
me
and
sat
upon
my
thumb
as
he
used
to
do
and
continued
talking
to
me
poor
robin
crusoe
and
how
did
i
come
here
and
where
had
i
been
just
as
if
he
had
been
overjoyed
to
see
me
again
and
so
i
carried
him
home
along
with
me
i
had
now
had
enough
of
rambling
to
sea
for
some
time
and
had
enough
to
do
for
many
days
to
sit
still
and
reflect
upon
the
danger
i
had
been
in
i
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
had
my
boat
again
on
my
side
of
the
island
but
i
knew
not
how
it
was
practicable
to
get
it
about
as
to
the
east
side
of
the
island
which
i
had
gone
round
i
knew
well
enough
there
was
no
venturing
that
way
my
very
heart
would
shrink
and
my
very
blood
run
chill
but
to
think
of
it
and
as
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
i
did
not
know
how
it
might
be
there
but
supposing
the
current
ran
with
the
same
force
against
the
shore
at
the
east
as
it
passed
by
it
on
the
other
i
might
run
the
same
risk
of
being
driven
down
the
stream
and
carried
by
the
island
as
i
had
been
before
of
being
carried
away
from
it
so
with
these
thoughts
i
contented
myself
to
be
without
any
boat
though
it
had
been
the
product
of
so
many
months
labour
to
make
it
and
of
so
many
more
to
get
it
into
the
sea
in
this
government
of
my
temper
i
remained
near
a
year
and
lived
a
very
sedate
retired
life
as
you
may
well
suppose
and
my
thoughts
being
very
much
composed
as
to
my
condition
and
fully
comforted
in
resigning
myself
to
the
dispositions
of
providence
i
thought
i
lived
really
very
happily
in
all
things
except
that
of
society
i
improved
myself
in
this
time
in
all
the
mechanic
exercises
which
my
necessities
put
me
upon
applying
myself
to
and
i
believe
i
should
upon
occasion
have
made
a
very
good
carpenter
especially
considering
how
few
tools
i
had
besides
this
i
arrived
at
an
unexpected
perfection
in
my
earthenware
and
contrived
well
enough
to
make
them
with
a
wheel
which
i
found
infinitely
easier
and
better
because
i
made
things
round
and
shaped
which
before
were
filthy
things
indeed
to
look
on
but
i
think
i
was
never
more
vain
of
my
own
performance
or
more
joyful
for
anything
i
found
out
than
for
my
being
able
to
make
a
tobacco
pipe
and
though
it
was
a
very
ugly
clumsy
thing
when
it
was
done
and
only
burned
red
like
other
earthenware
yet
as
it
was
hard
and
firm
and
would
draw
the
smoke
i
was
exceedingly
comforted
with
it
for
i
had
been
always
used
to
smoke
and
there
were
pipes
in
the
ship
but
i
forgot
them
at
first
not
thinking
there
was
tobacco
in
the
island
and
afterwards
when
i
searched
the
ship
again
i
could
not
come
at
any
pipes
in
my
wicker
ware
also
i
improved
much
and
made
abundance
of
necessary
baskets
as
well
as
my
invention
showed
me
though
not
very
handsome
yet
they
were
such
as
were
very
handy
and
convenient
for
laying
things
up
in
or
fetching
things
home
for
example
if
i
killed
a
goat
abroad
i
could
hang
it
up
in
a
tree
flay
it
dress
it
and
cut
it
in
pieces
and
bring
it
home
in
a
basket
and
the
like
by
a
turtle
i
could
cut
it
up
take
out
the
eggs
and
a
piece
or
two
of
the
flesh
which
was
enough
for
me
and
bring
them
home
in
a
basket
and
leave
the
rest
behind
me
also
large
deep
baskets
were
the
receivers
of
my
corn
which
i
always
rubbed
out
as
soon
as
it
was
dry
and
cured
and
kept
it
in
great
baskets
i
began
now
to
perceive
my
powder
abated
considerably
this
was
a
want
which
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
supply
and
i
began
seriously
to
consider
what
i
must
do
when
i
should
have
no
more
powder
that
is
to
say
how
i
should
kill
any
goats
i
had
as
is
observed
in
the
third
year
of
my
being
here
kept
a
young
kid
and
bred
her
up
tame
and
i
was
in
hopes
of
getting
a
he
goat
but
i
could
not
by
any
means
bring
it
to
pass
till
my
kid
grew
an
old
goat
and
as
i
could
never
find
in
my
heart
to
kill
her
she
died
at
last
of
mere
age
but
being
now
in
the
eleventh
year
of
my
residence
and
as
i
have
said
my
ammunition
growing
low
i
set
myself
to
study
some
art
to
trap
and
snare
the
goats
to
see
whether
i
could
not
catch
some
of
them
alive
and
particularly
i
wanted
a
she
goat
great
with
young
for
this
purpose
i
made
snares
to
hamper
them
and
i
do
believe
they
were
more
than
once
taken
in
them
but
my
tackle
was
not
good
for
i
had
no
wire
and
i
always
found
them
broken
and
my
bait
devoured
at
length
i
resolved
to
try
a
pitfall
so
i
dug
several
large
pits
in
the
earth
in
places
where
i
had
observed
the
goats
used
to
feed
and
over
those
pits
i
placed
hurdles
of
my
own
making
too
with
a
great
weight
upon
them
and
several
times
i
put
ears
of
barley
and
dry
rice
without
setting
the
trap
and
i
could
easily
perceive
that
the
goats
had
gone
in
and
eaten
up
the
corn
for
i
could
see
the
marks
of
their
feet
at
length
i
set
three
traps
in
one
night
and
going
the
next
morning
i
found
them
all
standing
and
yet
the
bait
eaten
and
gone
this
was
very
discouraging
however
i
altered
my
traps
and
not
to
trouble
you
with
particulars
going
one
morning
to
see
my
traps
i
found
in
one
of
them
a
large
old
he
goat
and
in
one
of
the
others
three
kids
a
male
and
two
females
as
to
the
old
one
i
knew
not
what
to
do
with
him
he
was
so
fierce
i
durst
not
go
into
the
pit
to
him
that
is
to
say
to
bring
him
away
alive
which
was
what
i
wanted
i
could
have
killed
him
but
that
was
not
my
business
nor
would
it
answer
my
end
so
i
even
let
him
out
and
he
ran
away
as
if
he
had
been
frightened
out
of
his
wits
but
i
did
not
then
know
what
i
afterwards
learned
that
hunger
will
tame
a
lion
if
i
had
let
him
stay
three
or
four
days
without
food
and
then
have
carried
him
some
water
to
drink
and
then
a
little
corn
he
would
have
been
as
tame
as
one
of
the
kids
for
they
are
mighty
sagacious
tractable
creatures
where
they
are
well
used
however
for
the
present
i
let
him
go
knowing
no
better
at
that
time
then
i
went
to
the
three
kids
and
taking
them
one
by
one
i
tied
them
with
strings
together
and
with
some
difficulty
brought
them
all
home
it
was
a
good
while
before
they
would
feed
but
throwing
them
some
sweet
corn
it
tempted
them
and
they
began
to
be
tame
and
now
i
found
that
if
i
expected
to
supply
myself
with
goats
flesh
when
i
had
no
powder
or
shot
left
breeding
some
up
tame
was
my
only
way
when
perhaps
i
might
have
them
about
my
house
like
a
flock
of
sheep
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
must
keep
the
tame
from
the
wild
or
else
they
would
always
run
wild
when
they
grew
up
and
the
only
way
for
this
was
to
have
some
enclosed
piece
of
ground
well
fenced
either
with
hedge
or
pale
to
keep
them
in
so
effectually
that
those
within
might
not
break
out
or
those
without
break
in
this
was
a
great
undertaking
for
one
pair
of
hands
yet
as
i
saw
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
doing
it
my
first
work
was
to
find
out
a
proper
piece
of
ground
where
there
was
likely
to
be
herbage
for
them
to
eat
water
for
them
to
drink
and
cover
to
keep
them
from
the
sun
those
who
understand
such
enclosures
will
think
i
had
very
little
contrivance
when
i
pitched
upon
a
place
very
proper
for
all
these
being
a
plain
open
piece
of
meadow
land
or
savannah
as
our
people
call
it
in
the
western
colonies
which
had
two
or
three
little
drills
of
fresh
water
in
it
and
at
one
end
was
very
woody
i
say
they
will
smile
at
my
forecast
when
i
shall
tell
them
i
began
by
enclosing
this
piece
of
ground
in
such
a
manner
that
my
hedge
or
pale
must
have
been
at
least
two
miles
about
nor
was
the
madness
of
it
so
great
as
to
the
compass
for
if
it
was
ten
miles
about
i
was
like
to
have
time
enough
to
do
it
in
but
i
did
not
consider
that
my
goats
would
be
as
wild
in
so
much
compass
as
if
they
had
had
the
whole
island
and
i
should
have
so
much
room
to
chase
them
in
that
i
should
never
catch
them
my
hedge
was
begun
and
carried
on
i
believe
about
fifty
yards
when
this
thought
occurred
to
me
so
i
presently
stopped
short
and
for
the
beginning
i
resolved
to
enclose
a
piece
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
length
and
one
hundred
yards
in
breadth
which
as
it
would
maintain
as
many
as
i
should
have
in
any
reasonable
time
so
as
my
stock
increased
i
could
add
more
ground
to
my
enclosure
this
was
acting
with
some
prudence
and
i
went
to
work
with
courage
i
was
about
three
months
hedging
in
the
first
piece
and
till
i
had
done
it
i
tethered
the
three
kids
in
the
best
part
of
it
and
used
them
to
feed
as
near
me
as
possible
to
make
them
familiar
and
very
often
i
would
go
and
carry
them
some
ears
of
barley
or
a
handful
of
rice
and
feed
them
out
of
my
hand
so
that
after
my
enclosure
was
finished
and
i
let
them
loose
they
would
follow
me
up
and
down
bleating
after
me
for
a
handful
of
corn
this
answered
my
end
and
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
i
had
a
flock
of
about
twelve
goats
kids
and
all
and
in
two
years
more
i
had
three
and
forty
besides
several
that
i
took
and
killed
for
my
food
after
that
i
enclosed
five
several
pieces
of
ground
to
feed
them
in
with
little
pens
to
drive
them
to
take
them
as
i
wanted
and
gates
out
of
one
piece
of
ground
into
another
but
this
was
not
all
for
now
i
not
only
had
goat
s
flesh
to
feed
on
when
i
pleased
but
milk
too
a
thing
which
indeed
in
the
beginning
i
did
not
so
much
as
think
of
and
which
when
it
came
into
my
thoughts
was
really
an
agreeable
surprise
for
now
i
set
up
my
dairy
and
had
sometimes
a
gallon
or
two
of
milk
in
a
day
and
as
nature
who
gives
supplies
of
food
to
every
creature
dictates
even
naturally
how
to
make
use
of
it
so
i
that
had
never
milked
a
cow
much
less
a
goat
or
seen
butter
or
cheese
made
only
when
i
was
a
boy
after
a
great
many
essays
and
miscarriages
made
both
butter
and
cheese
at
last
also
salt
though
i
found
it
partly
made
to
my
hand
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
upon
some
of
the
rocks
of
the
sea
and
never
wanted
it
afterwards
how
mercifully
can
our
creator
treat
his
creatures
even
in
those
conditions
in
which
they
seemed
to
be
overwhelmed
in
destruction
how
can
he
sweeten
the
bitterest
providences
and
give
us
cause
to
praise
him
for
dungeons
and
prisons
what
a
table
was
here
spread
for
me
in
the
wilderness
where
i
saw
nothing
at
first
but
to
perish
for
hunger
chapter
xi
finds
print
of

s
foot
on
the
sand
it
would
have
made
a
stoic
smile
to
have
seen
me
and
my
little
family
sit
down
to
dinner
there
was
my
majesty
the
prince
and
lord
of
the
whole
island
i
had
the
lives
of
all
my
subjects
at
my
absolute
command
i
could
hang
draw
give
liberty
and
take
it
away
and
no
rebels
among
all
my
subjects
then
to
see
how
like
a
king
i
dined
too
all
alone
attended
by
my
servants
poll
as
if
he
had
been
my
favourite
was
the
only
person
permitted
to
talk
to
me
my
dog
who
was
now
grown
old
and
crazy
and
had
found
no
species
to
multiply
his
kind
upon
sat
always
at
my
right
hand
and
two
cats
one
on
one
side
of
the
table
and
one
on
the
other
expecting
now
and
then
a
bit
from
my
hand
as
a
mark
of
especial
favour
but
these
were
not
the
two
cats
which
i
brought
on
shore
at
first
for
they
were
both
of
them
dead
and
had
been
interred
near
my
habitation
by
my
own
hand
but
one
of
them
having
multiplied
by
i
know
not
what
kind
of
creature
these
were
two
which
i
had
preserved
tame
whereas
the
rest
ran
wild
in
the
woods
and
became
indeed
troublesome
to
me
at
last
for
they
would
often
come
into
my
house
and
plunder
me
too
till
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
shoot
them
and
did
kill
a
great
many
at
length
they
left
me
with
this
attendance
and
in
this
plentiful
manner
i
lived
neither
could
i
be
said
to
want
anything
but
society
and
of
that
some
time
after
this
i
was
likely
to
have
too
much
i
was
something
impatient
as
i
have
observed
to
have
the
use
of
my
boat
though
very
loath
to
run
any
more
hazards
and
therefore
sometimes
i
sat
contriving
ways
to
get
her
about
the
island
and
at
other
times
i
sat
myself
down
contented
enough
without
her
but
i
had
a
strange
uneasiness
in
my
mind
to
go
down
to
the
point
of
the
island
where
as
i
have
said
in
my
last
ramble
i
went
up
the
hill
to
see
how
the
shore
lay
and
how
the
current
set
that
i
might
see
what
i
had
to
do
this
inclination
increased
upon
me
every
day
and
at
length
i
resolved
to
travel
thither
by
land
following
the
edge
of
the
shore
i
did
so
but
had
any
one
in
england
met
such
a
man
as
i
was
it
must
either
have
frightened
him
or
raised
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
as
i
frequently
stood
still
to
look
at
myself
i
could
not
but
smile
at
the
notion
of
my
travelling
through
yorkshire
with
such
an
equipage
and
in
such
a
dress
be
pleased
to
take
a
sketch
of
my
figure
as
follows
i
had
a
great
high
shapeless
cap
made
of
a
goat
s
skin
with
a
flap
hanging
down
behind
as
well
to
keep
the
sun
from
me
as
to
shoot
the
rain
off
from
running
into
my
neck
nothing
being
so
hurtful
in
these
climates
as
the
rain
upon
the
flesh
under
the
clothes
i
had
a
short
jacket
of
goat
s
skin
the
skirts
coming
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
thighs
and
a
pair
of
open
kneed
breeches
of
the
same
the
breeches
were
made
of
the
skin
of
an
old
he
goat
whose
hair
hung
down
such
a
length
on
either
side
that
like
pantaloons
it
reached
to
the
middle
of
my
legs
stockings
and
shoes
i
had
none
but
had
made
me
a
pair
of
somethings
i
scarce
knew
what
to
call
them
like
buskins
to
flap
over
my
legs
and
lace
on
either
side
like
spatterdashes
but
of
a
most
barbarous
shape
as
indeed
were
all
the
rest
of
my
clothes
i
had
on
a
broad
belt
of
goat
s
skin
dried
which
i
drew
together
with
two
thongs
of
the
same
instead
of
buckles
and
in
a
kind
of
a
frog
on
either
side
of
this
instead
of
a
sword
and
dagger
hung
a
little
saw
and
a
hatchet
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
i
had
another
belt
not
so
broad
and
fastened
in
the
same
manner
which
hung
over
my
shoulder
and
at
the
end
of
it
under
my
left
arm
hung
two
pouches
both
made
of
goat
s
skin
too
in
one
of
which
hung
my
powder
in
the
other
my
shot
at
my
back
i
carried
my
basket
and
on
my
shoulder
my
gun
and
over
my
head
a
great
clumsy
ugly
goat
s
skin
umbrella
but
which
after
all
was
the
most
necessary
thing
i
had
about
me
next
to
my
gun
as
for
my
face
the
colour
of
it
was
really
not
so
mulatto
like
as
one
might
expect
from
a
man
not
at
all
careful
of
it
and
living
within
nine
or
ten
degrees
of
the
equinox
my
beard
i
had
once
suffered
to
grow
till
it
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
long
but
as
i
had
both
scissors
and
razors
sufficient
i
had
cut
it
pretty
short
except
what
grew
on
my
upper
lip
which
i
had
trimmed
into
a
large
pair
of
mahometan
whiskers
such
as
i
had
seen
worn
by
some
turks
at
sallee
for
the
moors
did
not
wear
such
though
the
turks
did
of
these
moustachios
or
whiskers
i
will
not
say
they
were
long
enough
to
hang
my
hat
upon
them
but
they
were
of
a
length
and
shape
monstrous
enough
and
such
as
in
england
would
have
passed
for
frightful
but
all
this
is
by
the
bye
for
as
to
my
figure
i
had
so
few
to
observe
me
that
it
was
of
no
manner
of
consequence
so
i
say
no
more
of
that
in
this
kind
of
dress
i
went
my
new
journey
and
was
out
five
or
six
days
i
travelled
first
along
the
sea
shore
directly
to
the
place
where
i
first
brought
my
boat
to
an
anchor
to
get
upon
the
rocks
and
having
no
boat
now
to
take
care
of
i
went
over
the
land
a
nearer
way
to
the
same
height
that
i
was
upon
before
when
looking
forward
to
the
points
of
the
rocks
which
lay
out
and
which
i
was
obliged
to
double
with
my
boat
as
is
said
above
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
sea
all
smooth
and
quiet
no
rippling
no
motion
no
current
any
more
there
than
in
other
places
i
was
at
a
strange
loss
to
understand
this
and
resolved
to
spend
some
time
in
the
observing
it
to
see
if
nothing
from
the
sets
of
the
tide
had
occasioned
it
but
i
was
presently
convinced
how
it
was
viz
that
the
tide
of
ebb
setting
from
the
west
and
joining
with
the
current
of
waters
from
some
great
river
on
the
shore
must
be
the
occasion
of
this
current
and
that
according
as
the
wind
blew
more
forcibly
from
the
west
or
from
the
north
this
current
came
nearer
or
went
farther
from
the
shore
for
waiting
thereabouts
till
evening
i
went
up
to
the
rock
again
and
then
the
tide
of
ebb
being
made
i
plainly
saw
the
current
again
as
before
only
that
it
ran
farther
off
being
near
half
a
league
from
the
shore
whereas
in
my
case
it
set
close
upon
the
shore
and
hurried
me
and
my
canoe
along
with
it
which
at
another
time
it
would
not
have
done
this
observation
convinced
me
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
observe
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
of
the
tide
and
i
might
very
easily
bring
my
boat
about
the
island
again
but
when
i
began
to
think
of
putting
it
in
practice
i
had
such
terror
upon
my
spirits
at
the
remembrance
of
the
danger
i
had
been
in
that
i
could
not
think
of
it
again
with
any
patience
but
on
the
contrary
i
took
up
another
resolution
which
was
more
safe
though
more
laborious
and
this
was
that
i
would
build
or
rather
make
me
another
periagua
or
canoe
and
so
have
one
for
one
side
of
the
island
and
one
for
the
other
you
are
to
understand
that
now
i
had
as
i
may
call
it
two
plantations
in
the
island
one
my
little
fortification
or
tent
with
the
wall
about
it
under
the
rock
with
the
cave
behind
me
which
by
this
time
i
had
enlarged
into
several
apartments
or
caves
one
within
another
one
of
these
which
was
the
driest
and
largest
and
had
a
door
out
beyond
my
wall
or
fortification
that
is
to
say
beyond
where
my
wall
joined
to
the
rock
was
all
filled
up
with
the
large
earthen
pots
of
which
i
have
given
an
account
and
with
fourteen
or
fifteen
great
baskets
which
would
hold
five
or
six
bushels
each
where
i
laid
up
my
stores
of
provisions
especially
my
corn
some
in
the
ear
cut
off
short
from
the
straw
and
the
other
rubbed
out
with
my
hand
as
for
my
wall
made
as
before
with
long
stakes
or
piles
those
piles
grew
all
like
trees
and
were
by
this
time
grown
so
big
and
spread
so
very
much
that
there
was
not
the
least
appearance
to
any
one
s
view
of
any
habitation
behind
them
near
this
dwelling
of
mine
but
a
little
farther
within
the
land
and
upon
lower
ground
lay
my
two
pieces
of
corn
land
which
i
kept
duly
cultivated
and
sowed
and
which
duly
yielded
me
their
harvest
in
its
season
and
whenever
i
had
occasion
for
more
corn
i
had
more
land
adjoining
as
fit
as
that
besides
this
i
had
my
country
seat
and
i
had
now
a
tolerable
plantation
there
also
for
first
i
had
my
little
bower
as
i
called
it
which
i
kept
in
repair
that
is
to
say
i
kept
the
hedge
which
encircled
it
in
constantly
fitted
up
to
its
usual
height
the
ladder
standing
always
in
the
inside
i
kept
the
trees
which
at
first
were
no
more
than
stakes
but
were
now
grown
very
firm
and
tall
always
cut
so
that
they
might
spread
and
grow
thick
and
wild
and
make
the
more
agreeable
shade
which
they
did
effectually
to
my
mind
in
the
middle
of
this
i
had
my
tent
always
standing
being
a
piece
of
a
sail
spread
over
poles
set
up
for
that
purpose
and
which
never
wanted
any
repair
or
renewing
and
under
this
i
had
made
me
a
squab
or
couch
with
the
skins
of
the
creatures
i
had
killed
and
with
other
soft
things
and
a
blanket
laid
on
them
such
as
belonged
to
our
sea
bedding
which
i
had
saved
and
a
great
watch
coat
to
cover
me
and
here
whenever
i
had
occasion
to
be
absent
from
my
chief
seat
i
took
up
my
country
habitation
adjoining
to
this
i
had
my
enclosures
for
my
cattle
that
is
to
say
my
goats
and
i
had
taken
an
inconceivable
deal
of
pains
to
fence
and
enclose
this
ground
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
it
kept
entire
lest
the
goats
should
break
through
that
i
never
left
off
till
with
infinite
labour
i
had
stuck
the
outside
of
the
hedge
so
full
of
small
stakes
and
so
near
to
one
another
that
it
was
rather
a
pale
than
a
hedge
and
there
was
scarce
room
to
put
a
hand
through
between
them
which
afterwards
when
those
stakes
grew
as
they
all
did
in
the
next
rainy
season
made
the
enclosure
strong
like
a
wall
indeed
stronger
than
any
wall
this
will
testify
for
me
that
i
was
not
idle
and
that
i
spared
no
pains
to
bring
to
pass
whatever
appeared
necessary
for
my
comfortable
support
for
i
considered
the
keeping
up
a
breed
of
tame
creatures
thus
at
my
hand
would
be
a
living
magazine
of
flesh
milk
butter
and
cheese
for
me
as
long
as
i
lived
in
the
place
if
it
were
to
be
forty
years
and
that
keeping
them
in
my
reach
depended
entirely
upon
my
perfecting
my
enclosures
to
such
a
degree
that
i
might
be
sure
of
keeping
them
together
which
by
this
method
indeed
i
so
effectually
secured
that
when
these
little
stakes
began
to
grow
i
had
planted
them
so
very
thick
that
i
was
forced
to
pull
some
of
them
up
again
in
this
place
also
i
had
my
grapes
growing
which
i
principally
depended
on
for
my
winter
store
of
raisins
and
which
i
never
failed
to
preserve
very
carefully
as
the
best
and
most
agreeable
dainty
of
my
whole
diet
and
indeed
they
were
not
only
agreeable
but
medicinal
wholesome
nourishing
and
refreshing
to
the
last
degree
as
this
was
also
about
half
way
between
my
other
habitation
and
the
place
where
i
had
laid
up
my
boat
i
generally
stayed
and
lay
here
in
my
way
thither
for
i
used
frequently
to
visit
my
boat
and
i
kept
all
things
about
or
belonging
to
her
in
very
good
order
sometimes
i
went
out
in
her
to
divert
myself
but
no
more
hazardous
voyages
would
i
go
scarcely
ever
above
a
stone
s
cast
or
two
from
the
shore
i
was
so
apprehensive
of
being
hurried
out
of
my
knowledge
again
by
the
currents
or
winds
or
any
other
accident
but
now
i
come
to
a
new
scene
of
my
life
it
happened
one
day
about
noon
going
towards
my
boat
i
was
exceedingly
surprised
with
the
print
of
a
man
s
naked
foot
on
the
shore
which
was
very
plain
to
be
seen
on
the
sand
i
stood
like
one
thunderstruck
or
as
if
i
had
seen
an
apparition
i
listened
i
looked
round
me
but
i
could
hear
nothing
nor
see
anything
i
went
up
to
a
rising
ground
to
look
farther
i
went
up
the
shore
and
down
the
shore
but
it
was
all
one
i
could
see
no
other
impression
but
that
one
i
went
to
it
again
to
see
if
there
were
any
more
and
to
observe
if
it
might
not
be
my
fancy
but
there
was
no
room
for
that
for
there
was
exactly
the
print
of
a
foot
toes
heel
and
every
part
of
a
foot
how
it
came
thither
i
knew
not
nor
could
i
in
the
least
imagine
but
after
innumerable
fluttering
thoughts
like
a
man
perfectly
confused
and
out
of
myself
i
came
home
to
my
fortification
not
feeling
as
we
say
the
ground
i
went
on
but
terrified
to
the
last
degree
looking
behind
me
at
every
two
or
three
steps
mistaking
every
bush
and
tree
and
fancying
every
stump
at
a
distance
to
be
a
man
nor
is
it
possible
to
describe
how
many
various
shapes
my
affrighted
imagination
represented
things
to
me
in
how
many
wild
ideas
were
found
every
moment
in
my
fancy
and
what
strange
unaccountable
whimsies
came
into
my
thoughts
by
the
way
when
i
came
to
my
castle
for
so
i
think
i
called
it
ever
after
this
i
fled
into
it
like
one
pursued
whether
i
went
over
by
the
ladder
as
first
contrived
or
went
in
at
the
hole
in
the
rock
which
i
had
called
a
door
i
cannot
remember
no
nor
could
i
remember
the
next
morning
for
never
frightened
hare
fled
to
cover
or
fox
to
earth
with
more
terror
of
mind
than
i
to
this
retreat
i
slept
none
that
night
the
farther
i
was
from
the
occasion
of
my
fright
the
greater
my
apprehensions
were
which
is
something
contrary
to
the
nature
of
such
things
and
especially
to
the
usual
practice
of
all
creatures
in
fear
but
i
was
so
embarrassed
with
my
own
frightful
ideas
of
the
thing
that
i
formed
nothing
but
dismal
imaginations
to
myself
even
though
i
was
now
a
great
way
off
sometimes
i
fancied
it
must
be
the
devil
and
reason
joined
in
with
me
in
this
supposition
for
how
should
any
other
thing
in
human
shape
come
into
the
place
where
was
the
vessel
that
brought
them
what
marks
were
there
of
any
other
footstep
and
how
was
it
possible
a
man
should
come
there
but
then
to
think
that
satan
should
take
human
shape
upon
him
in
such
a
place
where
there
could
be
no
manner
of
occasion
for
it
but
to
leave
the
print
of
his
foot
behind
him
and
that
even
for
no
purpose
too
for
he
could
not
be
sure
i
should
see
it
this
was
an
amusement
the
other
way
i
considered
that
the
devil
might
have
found
out
abundance
of
other
ways
to
have
terrified
me
than
this
of
the
single
print
of
a
foot
that
as
i
lived
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
he
would
never
have
been
so
simple
as
to
leave
a
mark
in
a
place
where
it
was
ten
thousand
to
one
whether
i
should
ever
see
it
or
not
and
in
the
sand
too
which
the
first
surge
of
the
sea
upon
a
high
wind
would
have
defaced
entirely
all
this
seemed
inconsistent
with
the
thing
itself
and
with
all
the
notions
we
usually
entertain
of
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
abundance
of
such
things
as
these
assisted
to
argue
me
out
of
all
apprehensions
of
its
being
the
devil
and
i
presently
concluded
then
that
it
must
be
some
more
dangerous
creature
viz
that
it
must
be
some
of
the
savages
of
the
mainland
opposite
who
had
wandered
out
to
sea
in
their
canoes
and
either
driven
by
the
currents
or
by
contrary
winds
had
made
the
island
and
had
been
on
shore
but
were
gone
away
again
to
sea
being
as
loath
perhaps
to
have
stayed
in
this
desolate
island
as
i
would
have
been
to
have
had
them
while
these
reflections
were
rolling
in
my
mind
i
was
very
thankful
in
my
thoughts
that
i
was
so
happy
as
not
to
be
thereabouts
at
that
time
or
that
they
did
not
see
my
boat
by
which
they
would
have
concluded
that
some
inhabitants
had
been
in
the
place
and
perhaps
have
searched
farther
for
me
then
terrible
thoughts
racked
my
imagination
about
their
having
found
out
my
boat
and
that
there
were
people
here
and
that
if
so
i
should
certainly
have
them
come
again
in
greater
numbers
and
devour
me
that
if
it
should
happen
that
they
should
not
find
me
yet
they
would
find
my
enclosure
destroy
all
my
corn
and
carry
away
all
my
flock
of
tame
goats
and
i
should
perish
at
last
for
mere
want
thus
my
fear
banished
all
my
religious
hope
all
that
former
confidence
in
god
which
was
founded
upon
such
wonderful
experience
as
i
had
had
of
his
goodness
as
if
he
that
had
fed
me
by
miracle
hitherto
could
not
preserve
by
his
power
the
provision
which
he
had
made
for
me
by
his
goodness
i
reproached
myself
with
my
laziness
that
would
not
sow
any
more
corn
one
year
than
would
just
serve
me
till
the
next
season
as
if
no
accident
could
intervene
to
prevent
my
enjoying
the
crop
that
was
upon
the
ground
and
this
i
thought
so
just
a
reproof
that
i
resolved
for
the
future
to
have
two
or
three
years
corn
beforehand
so
that
whatever
might
come
i
might
not
perish
for
want
of
bread
how
strange
a
chequer
work
of
providence
is
the
life
of
man
and
by
what
secret
different
springs
are
the
affections
hurried
about
as
different
circumstances
present
to
day
we
love
what
to
morrow
we
hate
to
day
we
seek
what
to
morrow
we
shun
to
day
we
desire
what
to
morrow
we
fear
nay
even
tremble
at
the
apprehensions
of
this
was
exemplified
in
me
at
this
time
in
the
most
lively
manner
imaginable
for
i
whose
only
affliction
was
that
i
seemed
banished
from
human
society
that
i
was
alone
circumscribed
by
the
boundless
ocean
cut
off
from
mankind
and
condemned
to
what
i
call
silent
life
that
i
was
as
one
whom
heaven
thought
not
worthy
to
be
numbered
among
the
living
or
to
appear
among
the
rest
of
his
creatures
that
to
have
seen
one
of
my
own
species
would
have
seemed
to
me
a
raising
me
from
death
to
life
and
the
greatest
blessing
that
heaven
itself
next
to
the
supreme
blessing
of
salvation
could
bestow
i
say
that
i
should
now
tremble
at
the
very
apprehensions
of
seeing
a
man
and
was
ready
to
sink
into
the
ground
at
but
the
shadow
or
silent
appearance
of
a
man
having
set
his
foot
in
the
island
such
is
the
uneven
state
of
human
life
and
it
afforded
me
a
great
many
curious
speculations
afterwards
when
i
had
a
little
recovered
my
first
surprise
i
considered
that
this
was
the
station
of
life
the
infinitely
wise
and
good
providence
of
god
had
determined
for
me
that
as
i
could
not
foresee
what
the
ends
of
divine
wisdom
might
be
in
all
this
so
i
was
not
to
dispute
his
sovereignty
who
as
i
was
his
creature
had
an
undoubted
right
by
creation
to
govern
and
dispose
of
me
absolutely
as
he
thought
fit
and
who
as
i
was
a
creature
that
had
offended
him
had
likewise
a
judicial
right
to
condemn
me
to
what
punishment
he
thought
fit
and
that
it
was
my
part
to
submit
to
bear
his
indignation
because
i
had
sinned
against
him
i
then
reflected
that
as
god
who
was
not
only
righteous
but
omnipotent
had
thought
fit
thus
to
punish
and
afflict
me
so
he
was
able
to
deliver
me
that
if
he
did
not
think
fit
to
do
so
it
was
my
unquestioned
duty
to
resign
myself
absolutely
and
entirely
to
his
will
and
on
the
other
hand
it
was
my
duty
also
to
hope
in
him
pray
to
him
and
quietly
to
attend
to
the
dictates
and
directions
of
his
daily
providence
these
thoughts
took
me
up
many
hours
days
nay
i
may
say
weeks
and
months
and
one
particular
effect
of
my
cogitations
on
this
occasion
i
cannot
omit
one
morning
early
lying
in
my
bed
and
filled
with
thoughts
about
my
danger
from
the
appearances
of
savages
i
found
it
discomposed
me
very
much
upon
which
these
words
of
the
scripture
came
into
my
thoughts
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
and
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
upon
this
rising
cheerfully
out
of
my
bed
my
heart
was
not
only
comforted
but
i
was
guided
and
encouraged
to
pray
earnestly
to
god
for
deliverance
when
i
had
done
praying
i
took
up
my
bible
and
opening
it
to
read
the
first
words
that
presented
to
me
were
wait
on
the
lord
and
be
of
good
cheer
and
he
shall
strengthen
thy
heart
wait
i
say
on
the
lord
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
comfort
this
gave
me
in
answer
i
thankfully
laid
down
the
book
and
was
no
more
sad
at
least
on
that
occasion
in
the
middle
of
these
cogitations
apprehensions
and
reflections
it
came
into
my
thoughts
one
day
that
all
this
might
be
a
mere
chimera
of
my
own
and
that
this
foot
might
be
the
print
of
my
own
foot
when
i
came
on
shore
from
my
boat
this
cheered
me
up
a
little
too
and
i
began
to
persuade
myself
it
was
all
a
delusion
that
it
was
nothing
else
but
my
own
foot
and
why
might
i
not
come
that
way
from
the
boat
as
well
as
i
was
going
that
way
to
the
boat
again
i
considered
also
that
i
could
by
no
means
tell
for
certain
where
i
had
trod
and
where
i
had
not
and
that
if
at
last
this
was
only
the
print
of
my
own
foot
i
had
played
the
part
of
those
fools
who
try
to
make
stories
of
spectres
and
apparitions
and
then
are
frightened
at
them
more
than
anybody
now
i
began
to
take
courage
and
to
peep
abroad
again
for
i
had
not
stirred
out
of
my
castle
for
three
days
and
nights
so
that
i
began
to
starve
for
provisions
for
i
had
little
or
nothing
within
doors
but
some
barley
cakes
and
water
then
i
knew
that
my
goats
wanted
to
be
milked
too
which
usually
was
my
evening
diversion
and
the
poor
creatures
were
in
great
pain
and
inconvenience
for
want
of
it
and
indeed
it
almost
spoiled
some
of
them
and
almost
dried
up
their
milk
encouraging
myself
therefore
with
the
belief
that
this
was
nothing
but
the
print
of
one
of
my
own
feet
and
that
i
might
be
truly
said
to
start
at
my
own
shadow
i
began
to
go
abroad
again
and
went
to
my
country
house
to
milk
my
flock
but
to
see
with
what
fear
i
went
forward
how
often
i
looked
behind
me
how
i
was
ready
every
now
and
then
to
lay
down
my
basket
and
run
for
my
life
it
would
have
made
any
one
have
thought
i
was
haunted
with
an
evil
conscience
or
that
i
had
been
lately
most
terribly
frightened
and
so
indeed
i
had
however
i
went
down
thus
two
or
three
days
and
having
seen
nothing
i
began
to
be
a
little
bolder
and
to
think
there
was
really
nothing
in
it
but
my
own
imagination
but
i
could
not
persuade
myself
fully
of
this
till
i
should
go
down
to
the
shore
again
and
see
this
print
of
a
foot
and
measure
it
by
my
own
and
see
if
there
was
any
similitude
or
fitness
that
i
might
be
assured
it
was
my
own
foot
but
when
i
came
to
the
place
first
it
appeared
evidently
to
me
that
when
i
laid
up
my
boat
i
could
not
possibly
be
on
shore
anywhere
thereabouts
secondly
when
i
came
to
measure
the
mark
with
my
own
foot
i
found
my
foot
not
so
large
by
a
great
deal
both
these
things
filled
my
head
with
new
imaginations
and
gave
me
the
vapours
again
to
the
highest
degree
so
that
i
shook
with
cold
like
one
in
an
ague
and
i
went
home
again
filled
with
the
belief
that
some
man
or
men
had
been
on
shore
there
or
in
short
that
the
island
was
inhabited
and
i
might
be
surprised
before
i
was
aware
and
what
course
to
take
for
my
security
i
knew
not
oh
what
ridiculous
resolutions
men
take
when
possessed
with
fear
it
deprives
them
of
the
use
of
those
means
which
reason
offers
for
their
relief
the
first
thing
i
proposed
to
myself
was
to
throw
down
my
enclosures
and
turn
all
my
tame
cattle
wild
into
the
woods
lest
the
enemy
should
find
them
and
then
frequent
the
island
in
prospect
of
the
same
or
the
like
booty
then
the
simple
thing
of
digging
up
my
two
corn
fields
lest
they
should
find
such
a
grain
there
and
still
be
prompted
to
frequent
the
island
then
to
demolish
my
bower
and
tent
that
they
might
not
see
any
vestiges
of
habitation
and
be
prompted
to
look
farther
in
order
to
find
out
the
persons
inhabiting
these
were
the
subject
of
the
first
night
s
cogitations
after
i
was
come
home
again
while
the
apprehensions
which
had
so
overrun
my
mind
were
fresh
upon
me
and
my
head
was
full
of
vapours
thus
fear
of
danger
is
ten
thousand
times
more
terrifying
than
danger
itself
when
apparent
to
the
eyes
and
we
find
the
burden
of
anxiety
greater
by
much
than
the
evil
which
we
are
anxious
about
and
what
was
worse
than
all
this
i
had
not
that
relief
in
this
trouble
that
from
the
resignation
i
used
to
practise
i
hoped
to
have
i
looked
i
thought
like
saul
who
complained
not
only
that
the
philistines
were
upon
him
but
that
god
had
forsaken
him
for
i
did
not
now
take
due
ways
to
compose
my
mind
by
crying
to
god
in
my
distress
and
resting
upon
his
providence
as
i
had
done
before
for
my
defence
and
deliverance
which
if
i
had
done
i
had
at
least
been
more
cheerfully
supported
under
this
new
surprise
and
perhaps
carried
through
it
with
more
resolution
this
confusion
of
my
thoughts
kept
me
awake
all
night
but
in
the
morning
i
fell
asleep
and
having
by
the
amusement
of
my
mind
been
as
it
were
tired
and
my
spirits
exhausted
i
slept
very
soundly
and
waked
much
better
composed
than
i
had
ever
been
before
and
now
i
began
to
think
sedately
and
upon
debate
with
myself
i
concluded
that
this
island
which
was
so
exceedingly
pleasant
fruitful
and
no
farther
from
the
mainland
than
as
i
had
seen
was
not
so
entirely
abandoned
as
i
might
imagine
that
although
there
were
no
stated
inhabitants
who
lived
on
the
spot
yet
that
there
might
sometimes
come
boats
off
from
the
shore
who
either
with
design
or
perhaps
never
but
when
they
were
driven
by
cross
winds
might
come
to
this
place
that
i
had
lived
there
fifteen
years
now
and
had
not
met
with
the
least
shadow
or
figure
of
any
people
yet
and
that
if
at
any
time
they
should
be
driven
here
it
was
probable
they
went
away
again
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
seeing
they
had
never
thought
fit
to
fix
here
upon
any
occasion
that
the
most
i
could
suggest
any
danger
from
was
from
any
casual
accidental
landing
of
straggling
people
from
the
main
who
as
it
was
likely
if
they
were
driven
hither
were
here
against
their
wills
so
they
made
no
stay
here
but
went
off
again
with
all
possible
speed
seldom
staying
one
night
on
shore
lest
they
should
not
have
the
help
of
the
tides
and
daylight
back
again
and
that
therefore
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
consider
of
some
safe
retreat
in
case
i
should
see
any
savages
land
upon
the
spot
now
i
began
sorely
to
repent
that
i
had
dug
my
cave
so
large
as
to
bring
a
door
through
again
which
door
as
i
said
came
out
beyond
where
my
fortification
joined
to
the
rock
upon
maturely
considering
this
therefore
i
resolved
to
draw
me
a
second
fortification
in
the
manner
of
a
semicircle
at
a
distance
from
my
wall
just
where
i
had
planted
a
double
row
of
trees
about
twelve
years
before
of
which
i
made
mention
these
trees
having
been
planted
so
thick
before
they
wanted
but
few
piles
to
be
driven
between
them
that
they
might
be
thicker
and
stronger
and
my
wall
would
be
soon
finished
so
that
i
had
now
a
double
wall
and
my
outer
wall
was
thickened
with
pieces
of
timber
old
cables
and
everything
i
could
think
of
to
make
it
strong
having
in
it
seven
little
holes
about
as
big
as
i
might
put
my
arm
out
at
in
the
inside
of
this
i
thickened
my
wall
to
about
ten
feet
thick
with
continually
bringing
earth
out
of
my
cave
and
laying
it
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
walking
upon
it
and
through
the
seven
holes
i
contrived
to
plant
the
muskets
of
which
i
took
notice
that
i
had
got
seven
on
shore
out
of
the
ship
these
i
planted
like
my
cannon
and
fitted
them
into
frames
that
held
them
like
a
carriage
so
that
i
could
fire
all
the
seven
guns
in
two
minutes
time
this
wall
i
was
many
a
weary
month
in
finishing
and
yet
never
thought
myself
safe
till
it
was
done
when
this
was
done
i
stuck
all
the
ground
without
my
wall
for
a
great
length
every
way
as
full
with
stakes
or
sticks
of
the
osier
like
wood
which
i
found
so
apt
to
grow
as
they
could
well
stand
insomuch
that
i
believe
i
might
set
in
near
twenty
thousand
of
them
leaving
a
pretty
large
space
between
them
and
my
wall
that
i
might
have
room
to
see
an
enemy
and
they
might
have
no
shelter
from
the
young
trees
if
they
attempted
to
approach
my
outer
wall
thus
in
two
years
time
i
had
a
thick
grove
and
in
five
or
six
years
time
i
had
a
wood
before
my
dwelling
growing
so
monstrously
thick
and
strong
that
it
was
indeed
perfectly
impassable
and
no
men
of
what
kind
soever
could
ever
imagine
that
there
was
anything
beyond
it
much
less
a
habitation
as
for
the
way
which
i
proposed
to
myself
to
go
in
and
out
for
i
left
no
avenue
it
was
by
setting
two
ladders
one
to
a
part
of
the
rock
which
was
low
and
then
broke
in
and
left
room
to
place
another
ladder
upon
that
so
when
the
two
ladders
were
taken
down
no
man
living
could
come
down
to
me
without
doing
himself
mischief
and
if
they
had
come
down
they
were
still
on
the
outside
of
my
outer
wall
thus
i
took
all
the
measures
human
prudence
could
suggest
for
my
own
preservation
and
it
will
be
seen
at
length
that
they
were
not
altogether
without
just
reason
though
i
foresaw
nothing
at
that
time
more
than
my
mere
fear
suggested
to
me
chapter
xii
a
cave
retreat
while
this
was
doing
i
was
not
altogether
careless
of
my
other
affairs
for
i
had
a
great
concern
upon
me
for
my
little
herd
of
goats
they
were
not
only
a
ready
supply
to
me
on
every
occasion
and
began
to
be
sufficient
for
me
without
the
expense
of
powder
and
shot
but
also
without
the
fatigue
of
hunting
after
the
wild
ones
and
i
was
loath
to
lose
the
advantage
of
them
and
to
have
them
all
to
nurse
up
over
again
for
this
purpose
after
long
consideration
i
could
think
of
but
two
ways
to
preserve
them
one
was
to
find
another
convenient
place
to
dig
a
cave
underground
and
to
drive
them
into
it
every
night
and
the
other
was
to
enclose
two
or
three
little
bits
of
land
remote
from
one
another
and
as
much
concealed
as
i
could
where
i
might
keep
about
half
a
dozen
young
goats
in
each
place
so
that
if
any
disaster
happened
to
the
flock
in
general
i
might
be
able
to
raise
them
again
with
little
trouble
and
time
and
this
though
it
would
require
a
good
deal
of
time
and
labour
i
thought
was
the
most
rational
design
accordingly
i
spent
some
time
to
find
out
the
most
retired
parts
of
the
island
and
i
pitched
upon
one
which
was
as
private
indeed
as
my
heart
could
wish
it
was
a
little
damp
piece
of
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
hollow
and
thick
woods
where
as
is
observed
i
almost
lost
myself
once
before
endeavouring
to
come
back
that
way
from
the
eastern
part
of
the
island
here
i
found
a
clear
piece
of
land
near
three
acres
so
surrounded
with
woods
that
it
was
almost
an
enclosure
by
nature
at
least
it
did
not
want
near
so
much
labour
to
make
it
so
as
the
other
piece
of
ground
i
had
worked
so
hard
at
i
immediately
went
to
work
with
this
piece
of
ground
and
in
less
than
a
month
s
time
i
had
so
fenced
it
round
that
my
flock
or
herd
call
it
which
you
please
which
were
not
so
wild
now
as
at
first
they
might
be
supposed
to
be
were
well
enough
secured
in
it
so
without
any
further
delay
i
removed
ten
young
she
goats
and
two
he
goats
to
this
piece
and
when
they
were
there
i
continued
to
perfect
the
fence
till
i
had
made
it
as
secure
as
the
other
which
however
i
did
at
more
leisure
and
it
took
me
up
more
time
by
a
great
deal
all
this
labour
i
was
at
the
expense
of
purely
from
my
apprehensions
on
account
of
the
print
of
a
man
s
foot
for
as
yet
i
had
never
seen
any
human
creature
come
near
the
island
and
i
had
now
lived
two
years
under
this
uneasiness
which
indeed
made
my
life
much
less
comfortable
than
it
was
before
as
may
be
well
imagined
by
any
who
know
what
it
is
to
live
in
the
constant
snare
of
the
fear
of
man
and
this
i
must
observe
with
grief
too
that
the
discomposure
of
my
mind
had
great
impression
also
upon
the
religious
part
of
my
thoughts
for
the
dread
and
terror
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
savages
and
cannibals
lay
so
upon
my
spirits
that
i
seldom
found
myself
in
a
due
temper
for
application
to
my
maker
at
least
not
with
the
sedate
calmness
and
resignation
of
soul
which
i
was
wont
to
do
i
rather
prayed
to
god
as
under
great
affliction
and
pressure
of
mind
surrounded
with
danger
and
in
expectation
every
night
of
being
murdered
and
devoured
before
morning
and
i
must
testify
from
my
experience
that
a
temper
of
peace
thankfulness
love
and
affection
is
much
the
more
proper
frame
for
prayer
than
that
of
terror
and
discomposure
and
that
under
the
dread
of
mischief
impending
a
man
is
no
more
fit
for
a
comforting
performance
of
the
duty
of
praying
to
god
than
he
is
for
a
repentance
on
a
sick
bed
for
these
discomposures
affect
the
mind
as
the
others
do
the
body
and
the
discomposure
of
the
mind
must
necessarily
be
as
great
a
disability
as
that
of
the
body
and
much
greater
praying
to
god
being
properly
an
act
of
the
mind
not
of
the
body
but
to
go
on
after
i
had
thus
secured
one
part
of
my
little
living
stock
i
went
about
the
whole
island
searching
for
another
private
place
to
make
such
another
deposit
when
wandering
more
to
the
west
point
of
the
island
than
i
had
ever
done
yet
and
looking
out
to
sea
i
thought
i
saw
a
boat
upon
the
sea
at
a
great
distance
i
had
found
a
perspective
glass
or
two
in
one
of
the
seamen
s
chests
which
i
saved
out
of
our
ship
but
i
had
it
not
about
me
and
this
was
so
remote
that
i
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
it
though
i
looked
at
it
till
my
eyes
were
not
able
to
hold
to
look
any
longer
whether
it
was
a
boat
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
as
i
descended
from
the
hill
i
could
see
no
more
of
it
so
i
gave
it
over
only
i
resolved
to
go
no
more
out
without
a
perspective
glass
in
my
pocket
when
i
was
come
down
the
hill
to
the
end
of
the
island
where
indeed
i
had
never
been
before
i
was
presently
convinced
that
the
seeing
the
print
of
a
man
s
foot
was
not
such
a
strange
thing
in
the
island
as
i
imagined
and
but
that
it
was
a
special
providence
that
i
was
cast
upon
the
side
of
the
island
where
the
savages
never
came
i
should
easily
have
known
that
nothing
was
more
frequent
than
for
the
canoes
from
the
main
when
they
happened
to
be
a
little
too
far
out
at
sea
to
shoot
over
to
that
side
of
the
island
for
harbour
likewise
as
they
often
met
and
fought
in
their
canoes
the
victors
having
taken
any
prisoners
would
bring
them
over
to
this
shore
where
according
to
their
dreadful
customs
being
all
cannibals
they
would
kill
and
eat
them
of
which
hereafter
when
i
was
come
down
the
hill
to
the
shore
as
i
said
above
being
the
sw
point
of
the
island
i
was
perfectly
confounded
and
amazed
nor
is
it
possible
for
me
to
express
the
horror
of
my
mind
at
seeing
the
shore
spread
with
skulls
hands
feet
and
other
bones
of
human
bodies
and
particularly
i
observed
a
place
where
there
had
been
a
fire
made
and
a
circle
dug
in
the
earth
like
a
cockpit
where
i
supposed
the
savage
wretches
had
sat
down
to
their
human
feastings
upon
the
bodies
of
their
fellow
creatures
i
was
so
astonished
with
the
sight
of
these
things
that
i
entertained
no
notions
of
any
danger
to
myself
from
it
for
a
long
while
all
my
apprehensions
were
buried
in
the
thoughts
of
such
a
pitch
of
inhuman
hellish
brutality
and
the
horror
of
the
degeneracy
of
human
nature
which
though
i
had
heard
of
it
often
yet
i
never
had
so
near
a
view
of
before
in
short
i
turned
away
my
face
from
the
horrid
spectacle
my
stomach
grew
sick
and
i
was
just
at
the
point
of
fainting
when
nature
discharged
the
disorder
from
my
stomach
and
having
vomited
with
uncommon
violence
i
was
a
little
relieved
but
could
not
bear
to
stay
in
the
place
a
moment
so
i
got
up
the
hill
again
with
all
the
speed
i
could
and
walked
on
towards
my
own
habitation
when
i
came
a
little
out
of
that
part
of
the
island
i
stood
still
awhile
as
amazed
and
then
recovering
myself
i
looked
up
with
the
utmost
affection
of
my
soul
and
with
a
flood
of
tears
in
my
eyes
gave
god
thanks
that
had
cast
my
first
lot
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
i
was
distinguished
from
such
dreadful
creatures
as
these
and
that
though
i
had
esteemed
my
present
condition
very
miserable
had
yet
given
me
so
many
comforts
in
it
that
i
had
still
more
to
give
thanks
for
than
to
complain
of
and
this
above
all
that
i
had
even
in
this
miserable
condition
been
comforted
with
the
knowledge
of
himself
and
the
hope
of
his
blessing
which
was
a
felicity
more
than
sufficiently
equivalent
to
all
the
misery
which
i
had
suffered
or
could
suffer
in
this
frame
of
thankfulness
i
went
home
to
my
castle
and
began
to
be
much
easier
now
as
to
the
safety
of
my
circumstances
than
ever
i
was
before
for
i
observed
that
these
wretches
never
came
to
this
island
in
search
of
what
they
could
get
perhaps
not
seeking
not
wanting
or
not
expecting
anything
here
and
having
often
no
doubt
been
up
the
covered
woody
part
of
it
without
finding
anything
to
their
purpose
i
knew
i
had
been
here
now
almost
eighteen
years
and
never
saw
the
least
footsteps
of
human
creature
there
before
and
i
might
be
eighteen
years
more
as
entirely
concealed
as
i
was
now
if
i
did
not
discover
myself
to
them
which
i
had
no
manner
of
occasion
to
do
it
being
my
only
business
to
keep
myself
entirely
concealed
where
i
was
unless
i
found
a
better
sort
of
creatures
than
cannibals
to
make
myself
known
to
yet
i
entertained
such
an
abhorrence
of
the
savage
wretches
that
i
have
been
speaking
of
and
of
the
wretched
inhuman
custom
of
their
devouring
and
eating
one
another
up
that
i
continued
pensive
and
sad
and
kept
close
within
my
own
circle
for
almost
two
years
after
this
when
i
say
my
own
circle
i
mean
by
it
my
three
plantations
viz
my
castle
my
country
seat
which
i
called
my
bower
and
my
enclosure
in
the
woods
nor
did
i
look
after
this
for
any
other
use
than
an
enclosure
for
my
goats
for
the
aversion
which
nature
gave
me
to
these
hellish
wretches
was
such
that
i
was
as
fearful
of
seeing
them
as
of
seeing
the
devil
himself
i
did
not
so
much
as
go
to
look
after
my
boat
all
this
time
but
began
rather
to
think
of
making
another
for
i
could
not
think
of
ever
making
any
more
attempts
to
bring
the
other
boat
round
the
island
to
me
lest
i
should
meet
with
some
of
these
creatures
at
sea
in
which
case
if
i
had
happened
to
have
fallen
into
their
hands
i
knew
what
would
have
been
my
lot
time
however
and
the
satisfaction
i
had
that
i
was
in
no
danger
of
being
discovered
by
these
people
began
to
wear
off
my
uneasiness
about
them
and
i
began
to
live
just
in
the
same
composed
manner
as
before
only
with
this
difference
that
i
used
more
caution
and
kept
my
eyes
more
about
me
than
i
did
before
lest
i
should
happen
to
be
seen
by
any
of
them
and
particularly
i
was
more
cautious
of
firing
my
gun
lest
any
of
them
being
on
the
island
should
happen
to
hear
it
it
was
therefore
a
very
good
providence
to
me
that
i
had
furnished
myself
with
a
tame
breed
of
goats
and
that
i
had
no
need
to
hunt
any
more
about
the
woods
or
shoot
at
them
and
if
i
did
catch
any
of
them
after
this
it
was
by
traps
and
snares
as
i
had
done
before
so
that
for
two
years
after
this
i
believe
i
never
fired
my
gun
once
off
though
i
never
went
out
without
it
and
what
was
more
as
i
had
saved
three
pistols
out
of
the
ship
i
always
carried
them
out
with
me
or
at
least
two
of
them
sticking
them
in
my
goat
skin
belt
i
also
furbished
up
one
of
the
great
cutlasses
that
i
had
out
of
the
ship
and
made
me
a
belt
to
hang
it
on
also
so
that
i
was
now
a
most
formidable
fellow
to
look
at
when
i
went
abroad
if
you
add
to
the
former
description
of
myself
the
particular
of
two
pistols
and
a
broadsword
hanging
at
my
side
in
a
belt
but
without
a
scabbard
things
going
on
thus
as
i
have
said
for
some
time
i
seemed
excepting
these
cautions
to
be
reduced
to
my
former
calm
sedate
way
of
living
all
these
things
tended
to
show
me
more
and
more
how
far
my
condition
was
from
being
miserable
compared
to
some
others
nay
to
many
other
particulars
of
life
which
it
might
have
pleased
god
to
have
made
my
lot
it
put
me
upon
reflecting
how
little
repining
there
would
be
among
mankind
at
any
condition
of
life
if
people
would
rather
compare
their
condition
with
those
that
were
worse
in
order
to
be
thankful
than
be
always
comparing
them
with
those
which
are
better
to
assist
their
murmurings
and
complainings
as
in
my
present
condition
there
were
not
really
many
things
which
i
wanted
so
indeed
i
thought
that
the
frights
i
had
been
in
about
these
savage
wretches
and
the
concern
i
had
been
in
for
my
own
preservation
had
taken
off
the
edge
of
my
invention
for
my
own
conveniences
and
i
had
dropped
a
good
design
which
i
had
once
bent
my
thoughts
upon
and
that
was
to
try
if
i
could
not
make
some
of
my
barley
into
malt
and
then
try
to
brew
myself
some
beer
this
was
really
a
whimsical
thought
and
i
reproved
myself
often
for
the
simplicity
of
it
for
i
presently
saw
there
would
be
the
want
of
several
things
necessary
to
the
making
my
beer
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
supply
as
first
casks
to
preserve
it
in
which
was
a
thing
that
as
i
have
observed
already
i
could
never
compass
no
though
i
spent
not
only
many
days
but
weeks
nay
months
in
attempting
it
but
to
no
purpose
in
the
next
place
i
had
no
hops
to
make
it
keep
no
yeast
to
make
it
work
no
copper
or
kettle
to
make
it
boil
and
yet
with
all
these
things
wanting
i
verily
believe
had
not
the
frights
and
terrors
i
was
in
about
the
savages
intervened
i
had
undertaken
it
and
perhaps
brought
it
to
pass
too
for
i
seldom
gave
anything
over
without
accomplishing
it
when
once
i
had
it
in
my
head
to
began
it
but
my
invention
now
ran
quite
another
way
for
night
and
day
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
i
might
destroy
some
of
the
monsters
in
their
cruel
bloody
entertainment
and
if
possible
save
the
victim
they
should
bring
hither
to
destroy
it
would
take
up
a
larger
volume
than
this
whole
work
is
intended
to
be
to
set
down
all
the
contrivances
i
hatched
or
rather
brooded
upon
in
my
thoughts
for
the
destroying
these
creatures
or
at
least
frightening
them
so
as
to
prevent
their
coming
hither
any
more
but
all
this
was
abortive
nothing
could
be
possible
to
take
effect
unless
i
was
to
be
there
to
do
it
myself
and
what
could
one
man
do
among
them
when
perhaps
there
might
be
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
together
with
their
darts
or
their
bows
and
arrows
with
which
they
could
shoot
as
true
to
a
mark
as
i
could
with
my
gun
sometimes
i
thought
if
digging
a
hole
under
the
place
where
they
made
their
fire
and
putting
in
five
or
six
pounds
of
gunpowder
which
when
they
kindled
their
fire
would
consequently
take
fire
and
blow
up
all
that
was
near
it
but
as
in
the
first
place
i
should
be
unwilling
to
waste
so
much
powder
upon
them
my
store
being
now
within
the
quantity
of
one
barrel
so
neither
could
i
be
sure
of
its
going
off
at
any
certain
time
when
it
might
surprise
them
and
at
best
that
it
would
do
little
more
than
just
blow
the
fire
about
their
ears
and
fright
them
but
not
sufficient
to
make
them
forsake
the
place
so
i
laid
it
aside
and
then
proposed
that
i
would
place
myself
in
ambush
in
some
convenient
place
with
my
three
guns
all
double
loaded
and
in
the
middle
of
their
bloody
ceremony
let
fly
at
them
when
i
should
be
sure
to
kill
or
wound
perhaps
two
or
three
at
every
shot
and
then
falling
in
upon
them
with
my
three
pistols
and
my
sword
i
made
no
doubt
but
that
if
there
were
twenty
i
should
kill
them
all
this
fancy
pleased
my
thoughts
for
some
weeks
and
i
was
so
full
of
it
that
i
often
dreamed
of
it
and
sometimes
that
i
was
just
going
to
let
fly
at
them
in
my
sleep
i
went
so
far
with
it
in
my
imagination
that
i
employed
myself
several
days
to
find
out
proper
places
to
put
myself
in
ambuscade
as
i
said
to
watch
for
them
and
i
went
frequently
to
the
place
itself
which
was
now
grown
more
familiar
to
me
but
while
my
mind
was
thus
filled
with
thoughts
of
revenge
and
a
bloody
putting
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
to
the
sword
as
i
may
call
it
the
horror
i
had
at
the
place
and
at
the
signals
of
the
barbarous
wretches
devouring
one
another
abetted
my
malice
well
at
length
i
found
a
place
in
the
side
of
the
hill
where
i
was
satisfied
i
might
securely
wait
till
i
saw
any
of
their
boats
coming
and
might
then
even
before
they
would
be
ready
to
come
on
shore
convey
myself
unseen
into
some
thickets
of
trees
in
one
of
which
there
was
a
hollow
large
enough
to
conceal
me
entirely
and
there
i
might
sit
and
observe
all
their
bloody
doings
and
take
my
full
aim
at
their
heads
when
they
were
so
close
together
as
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
that
i
should
miss
my
shot
or
that
i
could
fail
wounding
three
or
four
of
them
at
the
first
shot
in
this
place
then
i
resolved
to
fulfil
my
design
and
accordingly
i
prepared
two
muskets
and
my
ordinary
fowling
piece
the
two
muskets
i
loaded
with
a
brace
of
slugs
each
and
four
or
five
smaller
bullets
about
the
size
of
pistol
bullets
and
the
fowling
piece
i
loaded
with
near
a
handful
of
swan
shot
of
the
largest
size
i
also
loaded
my
pistols
with
about
four
bullets
each
and
in
this
posture
well
provided
with
ammunition
for
a
second
and
third
charge
i
prepared
myself
for
my
expedition
after
i
had
thus
laid
the
scheme
of
my
design
and
in
my
imagination
put
it
in
practice
i
continually
made
my
tour
every
morning
to
the
top
of
the
hill
which
was
from
my
castle
as
i
called
it
about
three
miles
or
more
to
see
if
i
could
observe
any
boats
upon
the
sea
coming
near
the
island
or
standing
over
towards
it
but
i
began
to
tire
of
this
hard
duty
after
i
had
for
two
or
three
months
constantly
kept
my
watch
but
came
always
back
without
any
discovery
there
having
not
in
all
that
time
been
the
least
appearance
not
only
on
or
near
the
shore
but
on
the
whole
ocean
so
far
as
my
eye
or
glass
could
reach
every
way
as
long
as
i
kept
my
daily
tour
to
the
hill
to
look
out
so
long
also
i
kept
up
the
vigour
of
my
design
and
my
spirits
seemed
to
be
all
the
while
in
a
suitable
frame
for
so
outrageous
an
execution
as
the
killing
twenty
or
thirty
naked
savages
for
an
offence
which
i
had
not
at
all
entered
into
any
discussion
of
in
my
thoughts
any
farther
than
my
passions
were
at
first
fired
by
the
horror
i
conceived
at
the
unnatural
custom
of
the
people
of
that
country
who
it
seems
had
been
suffered
by
providence
in
his
wise
disposition
of
the
world
to
have
no
other
guide
than
that
of
their
own
abominable
and
vitiated
passions
and
consequently
were
left
and
perhaps
had
been
so
for
some
ages
to
act
such
horrid
things
and
receive
such
dreadful
customs
as
nothing
but
nature
entirely
abandoned
by
heaven
and
actuated
by
some
hellish
degeneracy
could
have
run
them
into
but
now
when
as
i
have
said
i
began
to
be
weary
of
the
fruitless
excursion
which
i
had
made
so
long
and
so
far
every
morning
in
vain
so
my
opinion
of
the
action
itself
began
to
alter
and
i
began
with
cooler
and
calmer
thoughts
to
consider
what
i
was
going
to
engage
in
what
authority
or
call
i
had
to
pretend
to
be
judge
and
executioner
upon
these
men
as
criminals
whom
heaven
had
thought
fit
for
so
many
ages
to
suffer
unpunished
to
go
on
and
to
be
as
it
were
the
executioners
of
his
judgments
one
upon
another
how
far
these
people
were
offenders
against
me
and
what
right
i
had
to
engage
in
the
quarrel
of
that
blood
which
they
shed
promiscuously
upon
one
another
i
debated
this
very
often
with
myself
thus
how
do
i
know
what
god
himself
judges
in
this
particular
case
it
is
certain
these
people
do
not
commit
this
as
a
crime
it
is
not
against
their
own
consciences
reproving
or
their
light
reproaching
them
they
do
not
know
it
to
be
an
offence
and
then
commit
it
in
defiance
of
divine
justice
as
we
do
in
almost
all
the
sins
we
commit
they
think
it
no
more
a
crime
to
kill
a
captive
taken
in
war
than
we
do
to
kill
an
ox
or
to
eat
human
flesh
than
we
do
to
eat
mutton
when
i
considered
this
a
little
it
followed
necessarily
that
i
was
certainly
in
the
wrong
that
these
people
were
not
murderers
in
the
sense
that
i
had
before
condemned
them
in
my
thoughts
any
more
than
those
christians
were
murderers
who
often
put
to
death
the
prisoners
taken
in
battle
or
more
frequently
upon
many
occasions
put
whole
troops
of
men
to
the
sword
without
giving
quarter
though
they
threw
down
their
arms
and
submitted
in
the
next
place
it
occurred
to
me
that
although
the
usage
they
gave
one
another
was
thus
brutish
and
inhuman
yet
it
was
really
nothing
to
me
these
people
had
done
me
no
injury
that
if
they
attempted
or
i
saw
it
necessary
for
my
immediate
preservation
to
fall
upon
them
something
might
be
said
for
it
but
that
i
was
yet
out
of
their
power
and
they
really
had
no
knowledge
of
me
and
consequently
no
design
upon
me
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
just
for
me
to
fall
upon
them
that
this
would
justify
the
conduct
of
the
spaniards
in
all
their
barbarities
practised
in
america
where
they
destroyed
millions
of
these
people
who
however
they
were
idolators
and
barbarians
and
had
several
bloody
and
barbarous
rites
in
their
customs
such
as
sacrificing
human
bodies
to
their
idols
were
yet
as
to
the
spaniards
very
innocent
people
and
that
the
rooting
them
out
of
the
country
is
spoken
of
with
the
utmost
abhorrence
and
detestation
by
even
the
spaniards
themselves
at
this
time
and
by
all
other
christian
nations
of
europe
as
a
mere
butchery
a
bloody
and
unnatural
piece
of
cruelty
unjustifiable
either
to
god
or
man
and
for
which
the
very
name
of
a
spaniard
is
reckoned
to
be
frightful
and
terrible
to
all
people
of
humanity
or
of
christian
compassion
as
if
the
kingdom
of
spain
were
particularly
eminent
for
the
produce
of
a
race
of
men
who
were
without
principles
of
tenderness
or
the
common
bowels
of
pity
to
the
miserable
which
is
reckoned
to
be
a
mark
of
generous
temper
in
the
mind
these
considerations
really
put
me
to
a
pause
and
to
a
kind
of
a
full
stop
and
i
began
by
little
and
little
to
be
off
my
design
and
to
conclude
i
had
taken
wrong
measures
in
my
resolution
to
attack
the
savages
and
that
it
was
not
my
business
to
meddle
with
them
unless
they
first
attacked
me
and
this
it
was
my
business
if
possible
to
prevent
but
that
if
i
were
discovered
and
attacked
by
them
i
knew
my
duty
on
the
other
hand
i
argued
with
myself
that
this
really
was
the
way
not
to
deliver
myself
but
entirely
to
ruin
and
destroy
myself
for
unless
i
was
sure
to
kill
every
one
that
not
only
should
be
on
shore
at
that
time
but
that
should
ever
come
on
shore
afterwards
if
but
one
of
them
escaped
to
tell
their
country
people
what
had
happened
they
would
come
over
again
by
thousands
to
revenge
the
death
of
their
fellows
and
i
should
only
bring
upon
myself
a
certain
destruction
which
at
present
i
had
no
manner
of
occasion
for
upon
the
whole
i
concluded
that
i
ought
neither
in
principle
nor
in
policy
one
way
or
other
to
concern
myself
in
this
affair
that
my
business
was
by
all
possible
means
to
conceal
myself
from
them
and
not
to
leave
the
least
sign
for
them
to
guess
by
that
there
were
any
living
creatures
upon
the
island
i
mean
of
human
shape
religion
joined
in
with
this
prudential
resolution
and
i
was
convinced
now
many
ways
that
i
was
perfectly
out
of
my
duty
when
i
was
laying
all
my
bloody
schemes
for
the
destruction
of
innocent
creatures
i
mean
innocent
as
to
me
as
to
the
crimes
they
were
guilty
of
towards
one
another
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
they
were
national
and
i
ought
to
leave
them
to
the
justice
of
god
who
is
the
governor
of
nations
and
knows
how
by
national
punishments
to
make
a
just
retribution
for
national
offences
and
to
bring
public
judgments
upon
those
who
offend
in
a
public
manner
by
such
ways
as
best
please
him
this
appeared
so
clear
to
me
now
that
nothing
was
a
greater
satisfaction
to
me
than
that
i
had
not
been
suffered
to
do
a
thing
which
i
now
saw
so
much
reason
to
believe
would
have
been
no
less
a
sin
than
that
of
wilful
murder
if
i
had
committed
it
and
i
gave
most
humble
thanks
on
my
knees
to
god
that
he
had
thus
delivered
me
from
blood
guiltiness
beseeching
him
to
grant
me
the
protection
of
his
providence
that
i
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
barbarians
or
that
i
might
not
lay
my
hands
upon
them
unless
i
had
a
more
clear
call
from
heaven
to
do
it
in
defence
of
my
own
life
in
this
disposition
i
continued
for
near
a
year
after
this
and
so
far
was
i
from
desiring
an
occasion
for
falling
upon
these
wretches
that
in
all
that
time
i
never
once
went
up
the
hill
to
see
whether
there
were
any
of
them
in
sight
or
to
know
whether
any
of
them
had
been
on
shore
there
or
not
that
i
might
not
be
tempted
to
renew
any
of
my
contrivances
against
them
or
be
provoked
by
any
advantage
that
might
present
itself
to
fall
upon
them
only
this
i
did
i
went
and
removed
my
boat
which
i
had
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
carried
it
down
to
the
east
end
of
the
whole
island
where
i
ran
it
into
a
little
cove
which
i
found
under
some
high
rocks
and
where
i
knew
by
reason
of
the
currents
the
savages
durst
not
at
least
would
not
come
with
their
boats
upon
any
account
whatever
with
my
boat
i
carried
away
everything
that
i
had
left
there
belonging
to
her
though
not
necessary
for
the
bare
going
thither
viz
a
mast
and
sail
which
i
had
made
for
her
and
a
thing
like
an
anchor
but
which
indeed
could
not
be
called
either
anchor
or
grapnel
however
it
was
the
best
i
could
make
of
its
kind
all
these
i
removed
that
there
might
not
be
the
least
shadow
for
discovery
or
appearance
of
any
boat
or
of
any
human
habitation
upon
the
island
besides
this
i
kept
myself
as
i
said
more
retired
than
ever
and
seldom
went
from
my
cell
except
upon
my
constant
employment
to
milk
my
she
goats
and
manage
my
little
flock
in
the
wood
which
as
it
was
quite
on
the
other
part
of
the
island
was
out
of
danger
for
certain
it
is
that
these
savage
people
who
sometimes
haunted
this
island
never
came
with
any
thoughts
of
finding
anything
here
and
consequently
never
wandered
off
from
the
coast
and
i
doubt
not
but
they
might
have
been
several
times
on
shore
after
my
apprehensions
of
them
had
made
me
cautious
as
well
as
before
indeed
i
looked
back
with
some
horror
upon
the
thoughts
of
what
my
condition
would
have
been
if
i
had
chopped
upon
them
and
been
discovered
before
that
when
naked
and
unarmed
except
with
one
gun
and
that
loaded
often
only
with
small
shot
i
walked
everywhere
peeping
and
peering
about
the
island
to
see
what
i
could
get
what
a
surprise
should
i
have
been
in
if
when
i
discovered
the
print
of
a
man
s
foot
i
had
instead
of
that
seen
fifteen
or
twenty
savages
and
found
them
pursuing
me
and
by
the
swiftness
of
their
running
no
possibility
of
my
escaping
them
the
thoughts
of
this
sometimes
sank
my
very
soul
within
me
and
distressed
my
mind
so
much
that
i
could
not
soon
recover
it
to
think
what
i
should
have
done
and
how
i
should
not
only
have
been
unable
to
resist
them
but
even
should
not
have
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
do
what
i
might
have
done
much
less
what
now
after
so
much
consideration
and
preparation
i
might
be
able
to
do
indeed
after
serious
thinking
of
these
things
i
would
be
melancholy
and
sometimes
it
would
last
a
great
while
but
i
resolved
it
all
at
last
into
thankfulness
to
that
providence
which
had
delivered
me
from
so
many
unseen
dangers
and
had
kept
me
from
those
mischiefs
which
i
could
have
no
way
been
the
agent
in
delivering
myself
from
because
i
had
not
the
least
notion
of
any
such
thing
depending
or
the
least
supposition
of
its
being
possible
this
renewed
a
contemplation
which
often
had
come
into
my
thoughts
in
former
times
when
first
i
began
to
see
the
merciful
dispositions
of
heaven
in
the
dangers
we
run
through
in
this
life
how
wonderfully
we
are
delivered
when
we
know
nothing
of
it
how
when
we
are
in
a
quandary
as
we
call
it
a
doubt
or
hesitation
whether
to
go
this
way
or
that
way
a
secret
hint
shall
direct
us
this
way
when
we
intended
to
go
that
way
nay
when
sense
our
own
inclination
and
perhaps
business
has
called
us
to
go
the
other
way
yet
a
strange
impression
upon
the
mind
from
we
know
not
what
springs
and
by
we
know
not
what
power
shall
overrule
us
to
go
this
way
and
it
shall
afterwards
appear
that
had
we
gone
that
way
which
we
should
have
gone
and
even
to
our
imagination
ought
to
have
gone
we
should
have
been
ruined
and
lost
upon
these
and
many
like
reflections
i
afterwards
made
it
a
certain
rule
with
me
that
whenever
i
found
those
secret
hints
or
pressings
of
mind
to
doing
or
not
doing
anything
that
presented
or
going
this
way
or
that
way
i
never
failed
to
obey
the
secret
dictate
though
i
knew
no
other
reason
for
it
than
such
a
pressure
or
such
a
hint
hung
upon
my
mind
i
could
give
many
examples
of
the
success
of
this
conduct
in
the
course
of
my
life
but
more
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
my
inhabiting
this
unhappy
island
besides
many
occasions
which
it
is
very
likely
i
might
have
taken
notice
of
if
i
had
seen
with
the
same
eyes
then
that
i
see
with
now
but
it
is
never
too
late
to
be
wise
and
i
cannot
but
advise
all
considering
men
whose
lives
are
attended
with
such
extraordinary
incidents
as
mine
or
even
though
not
so
extraordinary
not
to
slight
such
secret
intimations
of
providence
let
them
come
from
what
invisible
intelligence
they
will
that
i
shall
not
discuss
and
perhaps
cannot
account
for
but
certainly
they
are
a
proof
of
the
converse
of
spirits
and
a
secret
communication
between
those
embodied
and
those
unembodied
and
such
a
proof
as
can
never
be
withstood
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
give
some
remarkable
instances
in
the
remainder
of
my
solitary
residence
in
this
dismal
place
i
believe
the
reader
of
this
will
not
think
it
strange
if
i
confess
that
these
anxieties
these
constant
dangers
i
lived
in
and
the
concern
that
was
now
upon
me
put
an
end
to
all
invention
and
to
all
the
contrivances
that
i
had
laid
for
my
future
accommodations
and
conveniences
i
had
the
care
of
my
safety
more
now
upon
my
hands
than
that
of
my
food
i
cared
not
to
drive
a
nail
or
chop
a
stick
of
wood
now
for
fear
the
noise
i
might
make
should
be
heard
much
less
would
i
fire
a
gun
for
the
same
reason
and
above
all
i
was
intolerably
uneasy
at
making
any
fire
lest
the
smoke
which
is
visible
at
a
great
distance
in
the
day
should
betray
me
for
this
reason
i
removed
that
part
of
my
business
which
required
fire
such
as
burning
of
pots
and
pipes
c
into
my
new
apartment
in
the
woods
where
after
i
had
been
some
time
i
found
to
my
unspeakable
consolation
a
mere
natural
cave
in
the
earth
which
went
in
a
vast
way
and
where
i
daresay
no
savage
had
he
been
at
the
mouth
of
it
would
be
so
hardy
as
to
venture
in
nor
indeed
would
any
man
else
but
one
who
like
me
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
a
safe
retreat
the
mouth
of
this
hollow
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
great
rock
where
by
mere
accident
i
would
say
if
i
did
not
see
abundant
reason
to
ascribe
all
such
things
now
to
providence
i
was
cutting
down
some
thick
branches
of
trees
to
make
charcoal
and
before
i
go
on
i
must
observe
the
reason
of
my
making
this
charcoal
which
was
this
i
was
afraid
of
making
a
smoke
about
my
habitation
as
i
said
before
and
yet
i
could
not
live
there
without
baking
my
bread
cooking
my
meat
c
so
i
contrived
to
burn
some
wood
here
as
i
had
seen
done
in
england
under
turf
till
it
became
chark
or
dry
coal
and
then
putting
the
fire
out
i
preserved
the
coal
to
carry
home
and
perform
the
other
services
for
which
fire
was
wanting
without
danger
of
smoke
but
this
is
by
the
bye
while
i
was
cutting
down
some
wood
here
i
perceived
that
behind
a
very
thick
branch
of
low
brushwood
or
underwood
there
was
a
kind
of
hollow
place
i
was
curious
to
look
in
it
and
getting
with
difficulty
into
the
mouth
of
it
i
found
it
was
pretty
large
that
is
to
say
sufficient
for
me
to
stand
upright
in
it
and
perhaps
another
with
me
but
i
must
confess
to
you
that
i
made
more
haste
out
than
i
did
in
when
looking
farther
into
the
place
and
which
was
perfectly
dark
i
saw
two
broad
shining
eyes
of
some
creature
whether
devil
or
man
i
knew
not
which
twinkled
like
two
stars
the
dim
light
from
the
cave
s
mouth
shining
directly
in
and
making
the
reflection
however
after
some
pause
i
recovered
myself
and
began
to
call
myself
a
thousand
fools
and
to
think
that
he
that
was
afraid
to
see
the
devil
was
not
fit
to
live
twenty
years
in
an
island
all
alone
and
that
i
might
well
think
there
was
nothing
in
this
cave
that
was
more
frightful
than
myself
upon
this
plucking
up
my
courage
i
took
up
a
firebrand
and
in
i
rushed
again
with
the
stick
flaming
in
my
hand
i
had
not
gone
three
steps
in
before
i
was
almost
as
frightened
as
before
for
i
heard
a
very
loud
sigh
like
that
of
a
man
in
some
pain
and
it
was
followed
by
a
broken
noise
as
of
words
half
expressed
and
then
a
deep
sigh
again
i
stepped
back
and
was
indeed
struck
with
such
a
surprise
that
it
put
me
into
a
cold
sweat
and
if
i
had
had
a
hat
on
my
head
i
will
not
answer
for
it
that
my
hair
might
not
have
lifted
it
off
but
still
plucking
up
my
spirits
as
well
as
i
could
and
encouraging
myself
a
little
with
considering
that
the
power
and
presence
of
god
was
everywhere
and
was
able
to
protect
me
i
stepped
forward
again
and
by
the
light
of
the
firebrand
holding
it
up
a
little
over
my
head
i
saw
lying
on
the
ground
a
monstrous
frightful
old
he
goat
just
making
his
will
as
we
say
and
gasping
for
life
and
dying
indeed
of
mere
old
age
i
stirred
him
a
little
to
see
if
i
could
get
him
out
and
he
essayed
to
get
up
but
was
not
able
to
raise
himself
and
i
thought
with
myself
he
might
even
lie
there
for
if
he
had
frightened
me
so
he
would
certainly
fright
any
of
the
savages
if
any
of
them
should
be
so
hardy
as
to
come
in
there
while
he
had
any
life
in
him
i
was
now
recovered
from
my
surprise
and
began
to
look
round
me
when
i
found
the
cave
was
but
very
small
that
is
to
say
it
might
be
about
twelve
feet
over
but
in
no
manner
of
shape
neither
round
nor
square
no
hands
having
ever
been
employed
in
making
it
but
those
of
mere
nature
i
observed
also
that
there
was
a
place
at
the
farther
side
of
it
that
went
in
further
but
was
so
low
that
it
required
me
to
creep
upon
my
hands
and
knees
to
go
into
it
and
whither
it
went
i
knew
not
so
having
no
candle
i
gave
it
over
for
that
time
but
resolved
to
go
again
the
next
day
provided
with
candles
and
a
tinder
box
which
i
had
made
of
the
lock
of
one
of
the
muskets
with
some
wildfire
in
the
pan
accordingly
the
next
day
i
came
provided
with
six
large
candles
of
my
own
making
for
i
made
very
good
candles
now
of
goat
s
tallow
but
was
hard
set
for
candle
wick
using
sometimes
rags
or
rope
yarn
and
sometimes
the
dried
rind
of
a
weed
like
nettles
and
going
into
this
low
place
i
was
obliged
to
creep
upon
all
fours
as
i
have
said
almost
ten
yards
which
by
the
way
i
thought
was
a
venture
bold
enough
considering
that
i
knew
not
how
far
it
might
go
nor
what
was
beyond
it
when
i
had
got
through
the
strait
i
found
the
roof
rose
higher
up
i
believe
near
twenty
feet
but
never
was
such
a
glorious
sight
seen
in
the
island
i
daresay
as
it
was
to
look
round
the
sides
and
roof
of
this
vault
or
cave
the
wall
reflected
a
hundred
thousand
lights
to
me
from
my
two
candles
what
it
was
in
the
rock
whether
diamonds
or
any
other
precious
stones
or
gold
which
i
rather
supposed
it
to
be
i
knew
not
the
place
i
was
in
was
a
most
delightful
cavity
or
grotto
though
perfectly
dark
the
floor
was
dry
and
level
and
had
a
sort
of
a
small
loose
gravel
upon
it
so
that
there
was
no
nauseous
or
venomous
creature
to
be
seen
neither
was
there
any
damp
or
wet
on
the
sides
or
roof
the
only
difficulty
in
it
was
the
entrance
which
however
as
it
was
a
place
of
security
and
such
a
retreat
as
i
wanted
i
thought
was
a
convenience
so
that
i
was
really
rejoiced
at
the
discovery
and
resolved
without
any
delay
to
bring
some
of
those
things
which
i
was
most
anxious
about
to
this
place
particularly
i
resolved
to
bring
hither
my
magazine
of
powder
and
all
my
spare
arms
viz
two
fowling
pieces
for
i
had
three
in
all
and
three
muskets
for
of
them
i
had
eight
in
all
so
i
kept
in
my
castle
only
five
which
stood
ready
mounted
like
pieces
of
cannon
on
my
outmost
fence
and
were
ready
also
to
take
out
upon
any
expedition
upon
this
occasion
of
removing
my
ammunition
i
happened
to
open
the
barrel
of
powder
which
i
took
up
out
of
the
sea
and
which
had
been
wet
and
i
found
that
the
water
had
penetrated
about
three
or
four
inches
into
the
powder
on
every
side
which
caking
and
growing
hard
had
preserved
the
inside
like
a
kernel
in
the
shell
so
that
i
had
near
sixty
pounds
of
very
good
powder
in
the
centre
of
the
cask
this
was
a
very
agreeable
discovery
to
me
at
that
time
so
i
carried
all
away
thither
never
keeping
above
two
or
three
pounds
of
powder
with
me
in
my
castle
for
fear
of
a
surprise
of
any
kind
i
also
carried
thither
all
the
lead
i
had
left
for
bullets
i
fancied
myself
now
like
one
of
the
ancient
giants
who
were
said
to
live
in
caves
and
holes
in
the
rocks
where
none
could
come
at
them
for
i
persuaded
myself
while
i
was
here
that
if
five
hundred
savages
were
to
hunt
me
they
could
never
find
me
out
or
if
they
did
they
would
not
venture
to
attack
me
here
the
old
goat
whom
i
found
expiring
died
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
next
day
after
i
made
this
discovery
and
i
found
it
much
easier
to
dig
a
great
hole
there
and
throw
him
in
and
cover
him
with
earth
than
to
drag
him
out
so
i
interred
him
there
to
prevent
offence
to
my
nose
chapter
xiii
wreck
of
a
spanish
ship
i
was
now
in
the
twenty
third
year
of
my
residence
in
this
island
and
was
so
naturalised
to
the
place
and
the
manner
of
living
that
could
i
but
have
enjoyed
the
certainty
that
no
savages
would
come
to
the
place
to
disturb
me
i
could
have
been
content
to
have
capitulated
for
spending
the
rest
of
my
time
there
even
to
the
last
moment
till
i
had
laid
me
down
and
died
like
the
old
goat
in
the
cave
i
had
also
arrived
to
some
little
diversions
and
amusements
which
made
the
time
pass
a
great
deal
more
pleasantly
with
me
than
it
did
before
first
i
had
taught
my
poll
as
i
noted
before
to
speak
and
he
did
it
so
familiarly
and
talked
so
articulately
and
plain
that
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
and
he
lived
with
me
no
less
than
six
and
twenty
years
how
long
he
might
have
lived
afterwards
i
know
not
though
i
know
they
have
a
notion
in
the
brazils
that
they
live
a
hundred
years
my
dog
was
a
pleasant
and
loving
companion
to
me
for
no
less
than
sixteen
years
of
my
time
and
then
died
of
mere
old
age
as
for
my
cats
they
multiplied
as
i
have
observed
to
that
degree
that
i
was
obliged
to
shoot
several
of
them
at
first
to
keep
them
from
devouring
me
and
all
i
had
but
at
length
when
the
two
old
ones
i
brought
with
me
were
gone
and
after
some
time
continually
driving
them
from
me
and
letting
them
have
no
provision
with
me
they
all
ran
wild
into
the
woods
except
two
or
three
favourites
which
i
kept
tame
and
whose
young
when
they
had
any
i
always
drowned
and
these
were
part
of
my
family
besides
these
i
always
kept
two
or
three
household
kids
about
me
whom
i
taught
to
feed
out
of
my
hand
and
i
had
two
more
parrots
which
talked
pretty
well
and
would
all
call
robin
crusoe
but
none
like
my
first
nor
indeed
did
i
take
the
pains
with
any
of
them
that
i
had
done
with
him
i
had
also
several
tame
sea
fowls
whose
name
i
knew
not
that
i
caught
upon
the
shore
and
cut
their
wings
and
the
little
stakes
which
i
had
planted
before
my
castle
wall
being
now
grown
up
to
a
good
thick
grove
these
fowls
all
lived
among
these
low
trees
and
bred
there
which
was
very
agreeable
to
me
so
that
as
i
said
above
i
began
to
be
very
well
contented
with
the
life
i
led
if
i
could
have
been
secured
from
the
dread
of
the
savages
but
it
was
otherwise
directed
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
for
all
people
who
shall
meet
with
my
story
to
make
this
just
observation
from
it
how
frequently
in
the
course
of
our
lives
the
evil
which
in
itself
we
seek
most
to
shun
and
which
when
we
are
fallen
into
is
the
most
dreadful
to
us
is
oftentimes
the
very
means
or
door
of
our
deliverance
by
which
alone
we
can
be
raised
again
from
the
affliction
we
are
fallen
into
i
could
give
many
examples
of
this
in
the
course
of
my
unaccountable
life
but
in
nothing
was
it
more
particularly
remarkable
than
in
the
circumstances
of
my
last
years
of
solitary
residence
in
this
island
it
was
now
the
month
of
december
as
i
said
above
in
my
twenty
third
year
and
this
being
the
southern
solstice
for
winter
i
cannot
call
it
was
the
particular
time
of
my
harvest
and
required
me
to
be
pretty
much
abroad
in
the
fields
when
going
out
early
in
the
morning
even
before
it
was
thorough
daylight
i
was
surprised
with
seeing
a
light
of
some
fire
upon
the
shore
at
a
distance
from
me
of
about
two
miles
toward
that
part
of
the
island
where
i
had
observed
some
savages
had
been
as
before
and
not
on
the
other
side
but
to
my
great
affliction
it
was
on
my
side
of
the
island
i
was
indeed
terribly
surprised
at
the
sight
and
stopped
short
within
my
grove
not
daring
to
go
out
lest
i
might
be
surprised
and
yet
i
had
no
more
peace
within
from
the
apprehensions
i
had
that
if
these
savages
in
rambling
over
the
island
should
find
my
corn
standing
or
cut
or
any
of
my
works
or
improvements
they
would
immediately
conclude
that
there
were
people
in
the
place
and
would
then
never
rest
till
they
had
found
me
out
in
this
extremity
i
went
back
directly
to
my
castle
pulled
up
the
ladder
after
me
and
made
all
things
without
look
as
wild
and
natural
as
i
could
then
i
prepared
myself
within
putting
myself
in
a
posture
of
defence
i
loaded
all
my
cannon
as
i
called
them
that
is
to
say
my
muskets
which
were
mounted
upon
my
new
fortification
and
all
my
pistols
and
resolved
to
defend
myself
to
the
last
gasp
not
forgetting
seriously
to
commend
myself
to
the
divine
protection
and
earnestly
to
pray
to
god
to
deliver
me
out
of
the
hands
of
the
barbarians
i
continued
in
this
posture
about
two
hours
and
began
to
be
impatient
for
intelligence
abroad
for
i
had
no
spies
to
send
out
after
sitting
a
while
longer
and
musing
what
i
should
do
in
this
case
i
was
not
able
to
bear
sitting
in
ignorance
longer
so
setting
up
my
ladder
to
the
side
of
the
hill
where
there
was
a
flat
place
as
i
observed
before
and
then
pulling
the
ladder
after
me
i
set
it
up
again
and
mounted
the
top
of
the
hill
and
pulling
out
my
perspective
glass
which
i
had
taken
on
purpose
i
laid
me
down
flat
on
my
belly
on
the
ground
and
began
to
look
for
the
place
i
presently
found
there
were
no
less
than
nine
naked
savages
sitting
round
a
small
fire
they
had
made
not
to
warm
them
for
they
had
no
need
of
that
the
weather
being
extremely
hot
but
as
i
supposed
to
dress
some
of
their
barbarous
diet
of
human
flesh
which
they
had
brought
with
them
whether
alive
or
dead
i
could
not
tell
they
had
two
canoes
with
them
which
they
had
hauled
up
upon
the
shore
and
as
it
was
then
ebb
of
tide
they
seemed
to
me
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
flood
to
go
away
again
it
is
not
easy
to
imagine
what
confusion
this
sight
put
me
into
especially
seeing
them
come
on
my
side
of
the
island
and
so
near
to
me
but
when
i
considered
their
coming
must
be
always
with
the
current
of
the
ebb
i
began
afterwards
to
be
more
sedate
in
my
mind
being
satisfied
that
i
might
go
abroad
with
safety
all
the
time
of
the
flood
of
tide
if
they
were
not
on
shore
before
and
having
made
this
observation
i
went
abroad
about
my
harvest
work
with
the
more
composure
as
i
expected
so
it
proved
for
as
soon
as
the
tide
made
to
the
westward
i
saw
them
all
take
boat
and
row
or
paddle
as
we
call
it
away
i
should
have
observed
that
for
an
hour
or
more
before
they
went
off
they
were
dancing
and
i
could
easily
discern
their
postures
and
gestures
by
my
glass
i
could
not
perceive
by
my
nicest
observation
but
that
they
were
stark
naked
and
had
not
the
least
covering
upon
them
but
whether
they
were
men
or
women
i
could
not
distinguish
as
soon
as
i
saw
them
shipped
and
gone
i
took
two
guns
upon
my
shoulders
and
two
pistols
in
my
girdle
and
my
great
sword
by
my
side
without
a
scabbard
and
with
all
the
speed
i
was
able
to
make
went
away
to
the
hill
where
i
had
discovered
the
first
appearance
of
all
and
as
soon
as
i
get
thither
which
was
not
in
less
than
two
hours
for
i
could
not
go
quickly
being
so
loaded
with
arms
as
i
was
i
perceived
there
had
been
three
canoes
more
of
the
savages
at
that
place
and
looking
out
farther
i
saw
they
were
all
at
sea
together
making
over
for
the
main
this
was
a
dreadful
sight
to
me
especially
as
going
down
to
the
shore
i
could
see
the
marks
of
horror
which
the
dismal
work
they
had
been
about
had
left
behind
it
viz
the
blood
the
bones
and
part
of
the
flesh
of
human
bodies
eaten
and
devoured
by
those
wretches
with
merriment
and
sport
i
was
so
filled
with
indignation
at
the
sight
that
i
now
began
to
premeditate
the
destruction
of
the
next
that
i
saw
there
let
them
be
whom
or
how
many
soever
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
the
visits
which
they
made
thus
to
this
island
were
not
very
frequent
for
it
was
above
fifteen
months
before
any
more
of
them
came
on
shore
there
again
that
is
to
say
i
neither
saw
them
nor
any
footsteps
or
signals
of
them
in
all
that
time
for
as
to
the
rainy
seasons
then
they
are
sure
not
to
come
abroad
at
least
not
so
far
yet
all
this
while
i
lived
uncomfortably
by
reason
of
the
constant
apprehensions
of
their
coming
upon
me
by
surprise
from
whence
i
observe
that
the
expectation
of
evil
is
more
bitter
than
the
suffering
especially
if
there
is
no
room
to
shake
off
that
expectation
or
those
apprehensions
during
all
this
time
i
was
in
a
murdering
humour
and
spent
most
of
my
hours
which
should
have
been
better
employed
in
contriving
how
to
circumvent
and
fall
upon
them
the
very
next
time
i
should
see
them
especially
if
they
should
be
divided
as
they
were
the
last
time
into
two
parties
nor
did
i
consider
at
all
that
if
i
killed
one
party
suppose
ten
or
a
dozen
i
was
still
the
next
day
or
week
or
month
to
kill
another
and
so
another
even
ad
infinitum
till
i
should
be
at
length
no
less
a
murderer
than
they
were
in
being
man
eaters
and
perhaps
much
more
so
i
spent
my
days
now
in
great
perplexity
and
anxiety
of
mind
expecting
that
i
should
one
day
or
other
fall
into
the
hands
of
these
merciless
creatures
and
if
i
did
at
any
time
venture
abroad
it
was
not
without
looking
around
me
with
the
greatest
care
and
caution
imaginable
and
now
i
found
to
my
great
comfort
how
happy
it
was
that
i
had
provided
a
tame
flock
or
herd
of
goats
for
i
durst
not
upon
any
account
fire
my
gun
especially
near
that
side
of
the
island
where
they
usually
came
lest
i
should
alarm
the
savages
and
if
they
had
fled
from
me
now
i
was
sure
to
have
them
come
again
with
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
canoes
with
them
in
a
few
days
and
then
i
knew
what
to
expect
however
i
wore
out
a
year
and
three
months
more
before
i
ever
saw
any
more
of
the
savages
and
then
i
found
them
again
as
i
shall
soon
observe
it
is
true
they
might
have
been
there
once
or
twice
but
either
they
made
no
stay
or
at
least
i
did
not
see
them
but
in
the
month
of
may
as
near
as
i
could
calculate
and
in
my
four
and
twentieth
year
i
had
a
very
strange
encounter
with
them
of
which
in
its
place
the
perturbation
of
my
mind
during
this
fifteen
or
sixteen
months
interval
was
very
great
i
slept
unquietly
dreamed
always
frightful
dreams
and
often
started
out
of
my
sleep
in
the
night
in
the
day
great
troubles
overwhelmed
my
mind
and
in
the
night
i
dreamed
often
of
killing
the
savages
and
of
the
reasons
why
i
might
justify
doing
it
but
to
waive
all
this
for
a
while
it
was
in
the
middle
of
may
on
the
sixteenth
day
i
think
as
well
as
my
poor
wooden
calendar
would
reckon
for
i
marked
all
upon
the
post
still
i
say
it
was
on
the
sixteenth
of
may
that
it
blew
a
very
great
storm
of
wind
all
day
with
a
great
deal
of
lightning
and
thunder
and
a
very
foul
night
it
was
after
it
i
knew
not
what
was
the
particular
occasion
of
it
but
as
i
was
reading
in
the
bible
and
taken
up
with
very
serious
thoughts
about
my
present
condition
i
was
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
as
i
thought
fired
at
sea
this
was
to
be
sure
a
surprise
quite
of
a
different
nature
from
any
i
had
met
with
before
for
the
notions
this
put
into
my
thoughts
were
quite
of
another
kind
i
started
up
in
the
greatest
haste
imaginable
and
in
a
trice
clapped
my
ladder
to
the
middle
place
of
the
rock
and
pulled
it
after
me
and
mounting
it
the
second
time
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
the
very
moment
that
a
flash
of
fire
bid
me
listen
for
a
second
gun
which
accordingly
in
about
half
a
minute
i
heard
and
by
the
sound
knew
that
it
was
from
that
part
of
the
sea
where
i
was
driven
down
the
current
in
my
boat
i
immediately
considered
that
this
must
be
some
ship
in
distress
and
that
they
had
some
comrade
or
some
other
ship
in
company
and
fired
these
for
signals
of
distress
and
to
obtain
help
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
at
that
minute
to
think
that
though
i
could
not
help
them
it
might
be
that
they
might
help
me
so
i
brought
together
all
the
dry
wood
i
could
get
at
hand
and
making
a
good
handsome
pile
i
set
it
on
fire
upon
the
hill
the
wood
was
dry
and
blazed
freely
and
though
the
wind
blew
very
hard
yet
it
burned
fairly
out
so
that
i
was
certain
if
there
was
any
such
thing
as
a
ship
they
must
needs
see
it
and
no
doubt
they
did
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
fire
blazed
up
i
heard
another
gun
and
after
that
several
others
all
from
the
same
quarter
i
plied
my
fire
all
night
long
till
daybreak
and
when
it
was
broad
day
and
the
air
cleared
up
i
saw
something
at
a
great
distance
at
sea
full
east
of
the
island
whether
a
sail
or
a
hull
i
could
not
distinguish
no
not
with
my
glass
the
distance
was
so
great
and
the
weather
still
something
hazy
also
at
least
it
was
so
out
at
sea
i
looked
frequently
at
it
all
that
day
and
soon
perceived
that
it
did
not
move
so
i
presently
concluded
that
it
was
a
ship
at
anchor
and
being
eager
you
may
be
sure
to
be
satisfied
i
took
my
gun
in
my
hand
and
ran
towards
the
south
side
of
the
island
to
the
rocks
where
i
had
formerly
been
carried
away
by
the
current
and
getting
up
there
the
weather
by
this
time
being
perfectly
clear
i
could
plainly
see
to
my
great
sorrow
the
wreck
of
a
ship
cast
away
in
the
night
upon
those
concealed
rocks
which
i
found
when
i
was
out
in
my
boat
and
which
rocks
as
they
checked
the
violence
of
the
stream
and
made
a
kind
of
counter
stream
or
eddy
were
the
occasion
of
my
recovering
from
the
most
desperate
hopeless
condition
that
ever
i
had
been
in
in
all
my
life
thus
what
is
one
man
s
safety
is
another
man
s
destruction
for
it
seems
these
men
whoever
they
were
being
out
of
their
knowledge
and
the
rocks
being
wholly
under
water
had
been
driven
upon
them
in
the
night
the
wind
blowing
hard
at
ene
had
they
seen
the
island
as
i
must
necessarily
suppose
they
did
not
they
must
as
i
thought
have
endeavoured
to
have
saved
themselves
on
shore
by
the
help
of
their
boat
but
their
firing
off
guns
for
help
especially
when
they
saw
as
i
imagined
my
fire
filled
me
with
many
thoughts
first
i
imagined
that
upon
seeing
my
light
they
might
have
put
themselves
into
their
boat
and
endeavoured
to
make
the
shore
but
that
the
sea
running
very
high
they
might
have
been
cast
away
other
times
i
imagined
that
they
might
have
lost
their
boat
before
as
might
be
the
case
many
ways
particularly
by
the
breaking
of
the
sea
upon
their
ship
which
many
times
obliged
men
to
stave
or
take
in
pieces
their
boat
and
sometimes
to
throw
it
overboard
with
their
own
hands
other
times
i
imagined
they
had
some
other
ship
or
ships
in
company
who
upon
the
signals
of
distress
they
made
had
taken
them
up
and
carried
them
off
other
times
i
fancied
they
were
all
gone
off
to
sea
in
their
boat
and
being
hurried
away
by
the
current
that
i
had
been
formerly
in
were
carried
out
into
the
great
ocean
where
there
was
nothing
but
misery
and
perishing
and
that
perhaps
they
might
by
this
time
think
of
starving
and
of
being
in
a
condition
to
eat
one
another
as
all
these
were
but
conjectures
at
best
so
in
the
condition
i
was
in
i
could
do
no
more
than
look
on
upon
the
misery
of
the
poor
men
and
pity
them
which
had
still
this
good
effect
upon
my
side
that
it
gave
me
more
and
more
cause
to
give
thanks
to
god
who
had
so
happily
and
comfortably
provided
for
me
in
my
desolate
condition
and
that
of
two
ships
companies
who
were
now
cast
away
upon
this
part
of
the
world
not
one
life
should
be
spared
but
mine
i
learned
here
again
to
observe
that
it
is
very
rare
that
the
providence
of
god
casts
us
into
any
condition
so
low
or
any
misery
so
great
but
we
may
see
something
or
other
to
be
thankful
for
and
may
see
others
in
worse
circumstances
than
our
own
such
certainly
was
the
case
of
these
men
of
whom
i
could
not
so
much
as
see
room
to
suppose
any
were
saved
nothing
could
make
it
rational
so
much
as
to
wish
or
expect
that
they
did
not
all
perish
there
except
the
possibility
only
of
their
being
taken
up
by
another
ship
in
company
and
this
was
but
mere
possibility
indeed
for
i
saw
not
the
least
sign
or
appearance
of
any
such
thing
i
cannot
explain
by
any
possible
energy
of
words
what
a
strange
longing
i
felt
in
my
soul
upon
this
sight
breaking
out
sometimes
thus
oh
that
there
had
been
but
one
or
two
nay
or
but
one
soul
saved
out
of
this
ship
to
have
escaped
to
me
that
i
might
but
have
had
one
companion
one
fellow
creature
to
have
spoken
to
me
and
to
have
conversed
with
in
all
the
time
of
my
solitary
life
i
never
felt
so
earnest
so
strong
a
desire
after
the
society
of
my
fellow
creatures
or
so
deep
a
regret
at
the
want
of
it
there
are
some
secret
springs
in
the
affections
which
when
they
are
set
a
going
by
some
object
in
view
or
though
not
in
view
yet
rendered
present
to
the
mind
by
the
power
of
imagination
that
motion
carries
out
the
soul
by
its
impetuosity
to
such
violent
eager
embracings
of
the
object
that
the
absence
of
it
is
insupportable
such
were
these
earnest
wishings
that
but
one
man
had
been
saved
i
believe
i
repeated
the
words
oh
that
it
had
been
but
one
a
thousand
times
and
my
desires
were
so
moved
by
it
that
when
i
spoke
the
words
my
hands
would
clinch
together
and
my
fingers
would
press
the
palms
of
my
hands
so
that
if
i
had
had
any
soft
thing
in
my
hand
i
should
have
crushed
it
involuntarily
and
the
teeth
in
my
head
would
strike
together
and
set
against
one
another
so
strong
that
for
some
time
i
could
not
part
them
again
let
the
naturalists
explain
these
things
and
the
reason
and
manner
of
them
all
i
can
do
is
to
describe
the
fact
which
was
even
surprising
to
me
when
i
found
it
though
i
knew
not
from
whence
it
proceeded
it
was
doubtless
the
effect
of
ardent
wishes
and
of
strong
ideas
formed
in
my
mind
realising
the
comfort
which
the
conversation
of
one
of
my
fellow
christians
would
have
been
to
me
but
it
was
not
to
be
either
their
fate
or
mine
or
both
forbade
it
for
till
the
last
year
of
my
being
on
this
island
i
never
knew
whether
any
were
saved
out
of
that
ship
or
no
and
had
only
the
affliction
some
days
after
to
see
the
corpse
of
a
drowned
boy
come
on
shore
at
the
end
of
the
island
which
was
next
the
shipwreck
he
had
no
clothes
on
but
a
seaman
s
waistcoat
a
pair
of
open
kneed
linen
drawers
and
a
blue
linen
shirt
but
nothing
to
direct
me
so
much
as
to
guess
what
nation
he
was
of
he
had
nothing
in
his
pockets
but
two
pieces
of
eight
and
a
tobacco
pipe
the
last
was
to
me
of
ten
times
more
value
than
the
first
it
was
now
calm
and
i
had
a
great
mind
to
venture
out
in
my
boat
to
this
wreck
not
doubting
but
i
might
find
something
on
board
that
might
be
useful
to
me
but
that
did
not
altogether
press
me
so
much
as
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
yet
some
living
creature
on
board
whose
life
i
might
not
only
save
but
might
by
saving
that
life
comfort
my
own
to
the
last
degree
and
this
thought
clung
so
to
my
heart
that
i
could
not
be
quiet
night
or
day
but
i
must
venture
out
in
my
boat
on
board
this
wreck
and
committing
the
rest
to
god
s
providence
i
thought
the
impression
was
so
strong
upon
my
mind
that
it
could
not
be
resisted
that
it
must
come
from
some
invisible
direction
and
that
i
should
be
wanting
to
myself
if
i
did
not
go
under
the
power
of
this
impression
i
hastened
back
to
my
castle
prepared
everything
for
my
voyage
took
a
quantity
of
bread
a
great
pot
of
fresh
water
a
compass
to
steer
by
a
bottle
of
rum
for
i
had
still
a
great
deal
of
that
left
and
a
basket
of
raisins
and
thus
loading
myself
with
everything
necessary
i
went
down
to
my
boat
got
the
water
out
of
her
got
her
afloat
loaded
all
my
cargo
in
her
and
then
went
home
again
for
more
my
second
cargo
was
a
great
bag
of
rice
the
umbrella
to
set
up
over
my
head
for
a
shade
another
large
pot
of
water
and
about
two
dozen
of
small
loaves
or
barley
cakes
more
than
before
with
a
bottle
of
goat
s
milk
and
a
cheese
all
which
with
great
labour
and
sweat
i
carried
to
my
boat
and
praying
to
god
to
direct
my
voyage
i
put
out
and
rowing
or
paddling
the
canoe
along
the
shore
came
at
last
to
the
utmost
point
of
the
island
on
the
north
east
side
and
now
i
was
to
launch
out
into
the
ocean
and
either
to
venture
or
not
to
venture
i
looked
on
the
rapid
currents
which
ran
constantly
on
both
sides
of
the
island
at
a
distance
and
which
were
very
terrible
to
me
from
the
remembrance
of
the
hazard
i
had
been
in
before
and
my
heart
began
to
fail
me
for
i
foresaw
that
if
i
was
driven
into
either
of
those
currents
i
should
be
carried
a
great
way
out
to
sea
and
perhaps
out
of
my
reach
or
sight
of
the
island
again
and
that
then
as
my
boat
was
but
small
if
any
little
gale
of
wind
should
rise
i
should
be
inevitably
lost
these
thoughts
so
oppressed
my
mind
that
i
began
to
give
over
my
enterprise
and
having
hauled
my
boat
into
a
little
creek
on
the
shore
i
stepped
out
and
sat
down
upon
a
rising
bit
of
ground
very
pensive
and
anxious
between
fear
and
desire
about
my
voyage
when
as
i
was
musing
i
could
perceive
that
the
tide
was
turned
and
the
flood
come
on
upon
which
my
going
was
impracticable
for
so
many
hours
upon
this
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
go
up
to
the
highest
piece
of
ground
i
could
find
and
observe
if
i
could
how
the
sets
of
the
tide
or
currents
lay
when
the
flood
came
in
that
i
might
judge
whether
if
i
was
driven
one
way
out
i
might
not
expect
to
be
driven
another
way
home
with
the
same
rapidity
of
the
currents
this
thought
was
no
sooner
in
my
head
than
i
cast
my
eye
upon
a
little
hill
which
sufficiently
overlooked
the
sea
both
ways
and
from
whence
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
currents
or
sets
of
the
tide
and
which
way
i
was
to
guide
myself
in
my
return
here
i
found
that
as
the
current
of
ebb
set
out
close
by
the
south
point
of
the
island
so
the
current
of
the
flood
set
in
close
by
the
shore
of
the
north
side
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
to
the
north
side
of
the
island
in
my
return
and
i
should
do
well
enough
encouraged
by
this
observation
i
resolved
the
next
morning
to
set
out
with
the
first
of
the
tide
and
reposing
myself
for
the
night
in
my
canoe
under
the
watch
coat
i
mentioned
i
launched
out
i
first
made
a
little
out
to
sea
full
north
till
i
began
to
feel
the
benefit
of
the
current
which
set
eastward
and
which
carried
me
at
a
great
rate
and
yet
did
not
so
hurry
me
as
the
current
on
the
south
side
had
done
before
so
as
to
take
from
me
all
government
of
the
boat
but
having
a
strong
steerage
with
my
paddle
i
went
at
a
great
rate
directly
for
the
wreck
and
in
less
than
two
hours
i
came
up
to
it
it
was
a
dismal
sight
to
look
at
the
ship
which
by
its
building
was
spanish
stuck
fast
jammed
in
between
two
rocks
all
the
stern
and
quarter
of
her
were
beaten
to
pieces
by
the
sea
and
as
her
forecastle
which
stuck
in
the
rocks
had
run
on
with
great
violence
her
mainmast
and
foremast
were
brought
by
the
board
that
is
to
say
broken
short
off
but
her
bowsprit
was
sound
and
the
head
and
bow
appeared
firm
when
i
came
close
to
her
a
dog
appeared
upon
her
who
seeing
me
coming
yelped
and
cried
and
as
soon
as
i
called
him
jumped
into
the
sea
to
come
to
me
i
took
him
into
the
boat
but
found
him
almost
dead
with
hunger
and
thirst
i
gave
him
a
cake
of
my
bread
and
he
devoured
it
like
a
ravenous
wolf
that
had
been
starving
a
fortnight
in
the
snow
i
then
gave
the
poor
creature
some
fresh
water
with
which
if
i
would
have
let
him
he
would
have
burst
himself
after
this
i
went
on
board
but
the
first
sight
i
met
with
was
two
men
drowned
in
the
cook
room
or
forecastle
of
the
ship
with
their
arms
fast
about
one
another
i
concluded
as
is
indeed
probable
that
when
the
ship
struck
it
being
in
a
storm
the
sea
broke
so
high
and
so
continually
over
her
that
the
men
were
not
able
to
bear
it
and
were
strangled
with
the
constant
rushing
in
of
the
water
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
under
water
besides
the
dog
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
ship
that
had
life
nor
any
goods
that
i
could
see
but
what
were
spoiled
by
the
water
there
were
some
casks
of
liquor
whether
wine
or
brandy
i
knew
not
which
lay
lower
in
the
hold
and
which
the
water
being
ebbed
out
i
could
see
but
they
were
too
big
to
meddle
with
i
saw
several
chests
which
i
believe
belonged
to
some
of
the
seamen
and
i
got
two
of
them
into
the
boat
without
examining
what
was
in
them
had
the
stern
of
the
ship
been
fixed
and
the
forepart
broken
off
i
am
persuaded
i
might
have
made
a
good
voyage
for
by
what
i
found
in
those
two
chests
i
had
room
to
suppose
the
ship
had
a
great
deal
of
wealth
on
board
and
if
i
may
guess
from
the
course
she
steered
she
must
have
been
bound
from
buenos
ayres
or
the
rio
de
la
plata
in
the
south
part
of
america
beyond
the
brazils
to
the
havannah
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
so
perhaps
to
spain
she
had
no
doubt
a
great
treasure
in
her
but
of
no
use
at
that
time
to
anybody
and
what
became
of
the
crew
i
then
knew
not
i
found
besides
these
chests
a
little
cask
full
of
liquor
of
about
twenty
gallons
which
i
got
into
my
boat
with
much
difficulty
there
were
several
muskets
in
the
cabin
and
a
great
powder
horn
with
about
four
pounds
of
powder
in
it
as
for
the
muskets
i
had
no
occasion
for
them
so
i
left
them
but
took
the
powder
horn
i
took
a
fire
shovel
and
tongs
which
i
wanted
extremely
as
also
two
little
brass
kettles
a
copper
pot
to
make
chocolate
and
a
gridiron
and
with
this
cargo
and
the
dog
i
came
away
the
tide
beginning
to
make
home
again
and
the
same
evening
about
an
hour
within
night
i
reached
the
island
again
weary
and
fatigued
to
the
last
degree
i
reposed
that
night
in
the
boat
and
in
the
morning
i
resolved
to
harbour
what
i
had
got
in
my
new
cave
and
not
carry
it
home
to
my
castle
after
refreshing
myself
i
got
all
my
cargo
on
shore
and
began
to
examine
the
particulars
the
cask
of
liquor
i
found
to
be
a
kind
of
rum
but
not
such
as
we
had
at
the
brazils
and
in
a
word
not
at
all
good
but
when
i
came
to
open
the
chests
i
found
several
things
of
great
use
to
me
for
example
i
found
in
one
a
fine
case
of
bottles
of
an
extraordinary
kind
and
filled
with
cordial
waters
fine
and
very
good
the
bottles
held
about
three
pints
each
and
were
tipped
with
silver
i
found
two
pots
of
very
good
succades
or
sweetmeats
so
fastened
also
on
the
top
that
the
salt
water
had
not
hurt
them
and
two
more
of
the
same
which
the
water
had
spoiled
i
found
some
very
good
shirts
which
were
very
welcome
to
me
and
about
a
dozen
and
a
half
of
white
linen
handkerchiefs
and
coloured
neckcloths
the
former
were
also
very
welcome
being
exceedingly
refreshing
to
wipe
my
face
in
a
hot
day
besides
this
when
i
came
to
the
till
in
the
chest
i
found
there
three
great
bags
of
pieces
of
eight
which
held
about
eleven
hundred
pieces
in
all
and
in
one
of
them
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
six
doubloons
of
gold
and
some
small
bars
or
wedges
of
gold
i
suppose
they
might
all
weigh
near
a
pound
in
the
other
chest
were
some
clothes
but
of
little
value
but
by
the
circumstances
it
must
have
belonged
to
the
gunner
s
mate
though
there
was
no
powder
in
it
except
two
pounds
of
fine
glazed
powder
in
three
flasks
kept
i
suppose
for
charging
their
fowling
pieces
on
occasion
upon
the
whole
i
got
very
little
by
this
voyage
that
was
of
any
use
to
me
for
as
to
the
money
i
had
no
manner
of
occasion
for
it
it
was
to
me
as
the
dirt
under
my
feet
and
i
would
have
given
it
all
for
three
or
four
pair
of
english
shoes
and
stockings
which
were
things
i
greatly
wanted
but
had
had
none
on
my
feet
for
many
years
i
had
indeed
got
two
pair
of
shoes
now
which
i
took
off
the
feet
of
two
drowned
men
whom
i
saw
in
the
wreck
and
i
found
two
pair
more
in
one
of
the
chests
which
were
very
welcome
to
me
but
they
were
not
like
our
english
shoes
either
for
ease
or
service
being
rather
what
we
call
pumps
than
shoes
i
found
in
this
seaman
s
chest
about
fifty
pieces
of
eight
in
rials
but
no
gold
i
supposed
this
belonged
to
a
poorer
man
than
the
other
which
seemed
to
belong
to
some
officer
well
however
i
lugged
this
money
home
to
my
cave
and
laid
it
up
as
i
had
done
that
before
which
i
had
brought
from
our
own
ship
but
it
was
a
great
pity
as
i
said
that
the
other
part
of
this
ship
had
not
come
to
my
share
for
i
am
satisfied
i
might
have
loaded
my
canoe
several
times
over
with
money
and
thought
i
if
i
ever
escape
to
england
it
might
lie
here
safe
enough
till
i
come
again
and
fetch
it
chapter
xiv
a
dream
realised
having
now
brought
all
my
things
on
shore
and
secured
them
i
went
back
to
my
boat
and
rowed
or
paddled
her
along
the
shore
to
her
old
harbour
where
i
laid
her
up
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
to
my
old
habitation
where
i
found
everything
safe
and
quiet
i
began
now
to
repose
myself
live
after
my
old
fashion
and
take
care
of
my
family
affairs
and
for
a
while
i
lived
easy
enough
only
that
i
was
more
vigilant
than
i
used
to
be
looked
out
oftener
and
did
not
go
abroad
so
much
and
if
at
any
time
i
did
stir
with
any
freedom
it
was
always
to
the
east
part
of
the
island
where
i
was
pretty
well
satisfied
the
savages
never
came
and
where
i
could
go
without
so
many
precautions
and
such
a
load
of
arms
and
ammunition
as
i
always
carried
with
me
if
i
went
the
other
way
i
lived
in
this
condition
near
two
years
more
but
my
unlucky
head
that
was
always
to
let
me
know
it
was
born
to
make
my
body
miserable
was
all
these
two
years
filled
with
projects
and
designs
how
if
it
were
possible
i
might
get
away
from
this
island
for
sometimes
i
was
for
making
another
voyage
to
the
wreck
though
my
reason
told
me
that
there
was
nothing
left
there
worth
the
hazard
of
my
voyage
sometimes
for
a
ramble
one
way
sometimes
another
and
i
believe
verily
if
i
had
had
the
boat
that
i
went
from
sallee
in
i
should
have
ventured
to
sea
bound
anywhere
i
knew
not
whither
i
have
been
in
all
my
circumstances
a
memento
to
those
who
are
touched
with
the
general
plague
of
mankind
whence
for
aught
i
know
one
half
of
their
miseries
flow
i
mean
that
of
not
being
satisfied
with
the
station
wherein
god
and
nature
hath
placed
them
for
not
to
look
back
upon
my
primitive
condition
and
the
excellent
advice
of
my
father
the
opposition
to
which
was
as
i
may
call
it
my
original
sin
my
subsequent
mistakes
of
the
same
kind
had
been
the
means
of
my
coming
into
this
miserable
condition
for
had
that
providence
which
so
happily
seated
me
at
the
brazils
as
a
planter
blessed
me
with
confined
desires
and
i
could
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
on
gradually
i
might
have
been
by
this
time
i
mean
in
the
time
of
my
being
in
this
island
one
of
the
most
considerable
planters
in
the
brazils
nay
i
am
persuaded
that
by
the
improvements
i
had
made
in
that
little
time
i
lived
there
and
the
increase
i
should
probably
have
made
if
i
had
remained
i
might
have
been
worth
a
hundred
thousand
moidores
and
what
business
had
i
to
leave
a
settled
fortune
a
well
stocked
plantation
improving
and
increasing
to
turn
supercargo
to
guinea
to
fetch
negroes
when
patience
and
time
would
have
so
increased
our
stock
at
home
that
we
could
have
bought
them
at
our
own
door
from
those
whose
business
it
was
to
fetch
them
and
though
it
had
cost
us
something
more
yet
the
difference
of
that
price
was
by
no
means
worth
saving
at
so
great
a
hazard
but
as
this
is
usually
the
fate
of
young
heads
so
reflection
upon
the
folly
of
it
is
as
commonly
the
exercise
of
more
years
or
of
the
dear
bought
experience
of
time
so
it
was
with
me
now
and
yet
so
deep
had
the
mistake
taken
root
in
my
temper
that
i
could
not
satisfy
myself
in
my
station
but
was
continually
poring
upon
the
means
and
possibility
of
my
escape
from
this
place
and
that
i
may
with
greater
pleasure
to
the
reader
bring
on
the
remaining
part
of
my
story
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
some
account
of
my
first
conceptions
on
the
subject
of
this
foolish
scheme
for
my
escape
and
how
and
upon
what
foundation
i
acted
i
am
now
to
be
supposed
retired
into
my
castle
after
my
late
voyage
to
the
wreck
my
frigate
laid
up
and
secured
under
water
as
usual
and
my
condition
restored
to
what
it
was
before
i
had
more
wealth
indeed
than
i
had
before
but
was
not
at
all
the
richer
for
i
had
no
more
use
for
it
than
the
indians
of
peru
had
before
the
spaniards
came
there
it
was
one
of
the
nights
in
the
rainy
season
in
march
the
four
and
twentieth
year
of
my
first
setting
foot
in
this
island
of
solitude
i
was
lying
in
my
bed
or
hammock
awake
very
well
in
health
had
no
pain
no
distemper
no
uneasiness
of
body
nor
any
uneasiness
of
mind
more
than
ordinary
but
could
by
no
means
close
my
eyes
that
is
so
as
to
sleep
no
not
a
wink
all
night
long
otherwise
than
as
follows
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
the
innumerable
crowd
of
thoughts
that
whirled
through
that
great
thoroughfare
of
the
brain
the
memory
in
this
night
s
time
i
ran
over
the
whole
history
of
my
life
in
miniature
or
by
abridgment
as
i
may
call
it
to
my
coming
to
this
island
and
also
of
that
part
of
my
life
since
i
came
to
this
island
in
my
reflections
upon
the
state
of
my
case
since
i
came
on
shore
on
this
island
i
was
comparing
the
happy
posture
of
my
affairs
in
the
first
years
of
my
habitation
here
with
the
life
of
anxiety
fear
and
care
which
i
had
lived
in
ever
since
i
had
seen
the
print
of
a
foot
in
the
sand
not
that
i
did
not
believe
the
savages
had
frequented
the
island
even
all
the
while
and
might
have
been
several
hundreds
of
them
at
times
on
shore
there
but
i
had
never
known
it
and
was
incapable
of
any
apprehensions
about
it
my
satisfaction
was
perfect
though
my
danger
was
the
same
and
i
was
as
happy
in
not
knowing
my
danger
as
if
i
had
never
really
been
exposed
to
it
this
furnished
my
thoughts
with
many
very
profitable
reflections
and
particularly
this
one
how
infinitely
good
that
providence
is
which
has
provided
in
its
government
of
mankind
such
narrow
bounds
to
his
sight
and
knowledge
of
things
and
though
he
walks
in
the
midst
of
so
many
thousand
dangers
the
sight
of
which
if
discovered
to
him
would
distract
his
mind
and
sink
his
spirits
he
is
kept
serene
and
calm
by
having
the
events
of
things
hid
from
his
eyes
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
dangers
which
surround
him
after
these
thoughts
had
for
some
time
entertained
me
i
came
to
reflect
seriously
upon
the
real
danger
i
had
been
in
for
so
many
years
in
this
very
island
and
how
i
had
walked
about
in
the
greatest
security
and
with
all
possible
tranquillity
even
when
perhaps
nothing
but
the
brow
of
a
hill
a
great
tree
or
the
casual
approach
of
night
had
been
between
me
and
the
worst
kind
of
destruction
viz
that
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
cannibals
and
savages
who
would
have
seized
on
me
with
the
same
view
as
i
would
on
a
goat
or
turtle
and
have
thought
it
no
more
crime
to
kill
and
devour
me
than
i
did
of
a
pigeon
or
a
curlew
i
would
unjustly
slander
myself
if
i
should
say
i
was
not
sincerely
thankful
to
my
great
preserver
to
whose
singular
protection
i
acknowledged
with
great
humanity
all
these
unknown
deliverances
were
due
and
without
which
i
must
inevitably
have
fallen
into
their
merciless
hands
when
these
thoughts
were
over
my
head
was
for
some
time
taken
up
in
considering
the
nature
of
these
wretched
creatures
i
mean
the
savages
and
how
it
came
to
pass
in
the
world
that
the
wise
governor
of
all
things
should
give
up
any
of
his
creatures
to
such
inhumanity
nay
to
something
so
much
below
even
brutality
itself
as
to
devour
its
own
kind
but
as
this
ended
in
some
at
that
time
fruitless
speculations
it
occurred
to
me
to
inquire
what
part
of
the
world
these
wretches
lived
in
how
far
off
the
coast
was
from
whence
they
came
what
they
ventured
over
so
far
from
home
for
what
kind
of
boats
they
had
and
why
i
might
not
order
myself
and
my
business
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
go
over
thither
as
they
were
to
come
to
me
i
never
so
much
as
troubled
myself
to
consider
what
i
should
do
with
myself
when
i
went
thither
what
would
become
of
me
if
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
these
savages
or
how
i
should
escape
them
if
they
attacked
me
no
nor
so
much
as
how
it
was
possible
for
me
to
reach
the
coast
and
not
to
be
attacked
by
some
or
other
of
them
without
any
possibility
of
delivering
myself
and
if
i
should
not
fall
into
their
hands
what
i
should
do
for
provision
or
whither
i
should
bend
my
course
none
of
these
thoughts
i
say
so
much
as
came
in
my
way
but
my
mind
was
wholly
bent
upon
the
notion
of
my
passing
over
in
my
boat
to
the
mainland
i
looked
upon
my
present
condition
as
the
most
miserable
that
could
possibly
be
that
i
was
not
able
to
throw
myself
into
anything
but
death
that
could
be
called
worse
and
if
i
reached
the
shore
of
the
main
i
might
perhaps
meet
with
relief
or
i
might
coast
along
as
i
did
on
the
african
shore
till
i
came
to
some
inhabited
country
and
where
i
might
find
some
relief
and
after
all
perhaps
i
might
fall
in
with
some
christian
ship
that
might
take
me
in
and
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
i
could
but
die
which
would
put
an
end
to
all
these
miseries
at
once
pray
note
all
this
was
the
fruit
of
a
disturbed
mind
an
impatient
temper
made
desperate
as
it
were
by
the
long
continuance
of
my
troubles
and
the
disappointments
i
had
met
in
the
wreck
i
had
been
on
board
of
and
where
i
had
been
so
near
obtaining
what
i
so
earnestly
longed
for
somebody
to
speak
to
and
to
learn
some
knowledge
from
them
of
the
place
where
i
was
and
of
the
probable
means
of
my
deliverance
i
was
agitated
wholly
by
these
thoughts
all
my
calm
of
mind
in
my
resignation
to
providence
and
waiting
the
issue
of
the
dispositions
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
suspended
and
i
had
as
it
were
no
power
to
turn
my
thoughts
to
anything
but
to
the
project
of
a
voyage
to
the
main
which
came
upon
me
with
such
force
and
such
an
impetuosity
of
desire
that
it
was
not
to
be
resisted
when
this
had
agitated
my
thoughts
for
two
hours
or
more
with
such
violence
that
it
set
my
very
blood
into
a
ferment
and
my
pulse
beat
as
if
i
had
been
in
a
fever
merely
with
the
extraordinary
fervour
of
my
mind
about
it
nature
as
if
i
had
been
fatigued
and
exhausted
with
the
very
thoughts
of
it
threw
me
into
a
sound
sleep
one
would
have
thought
i
should
have
dreamed
of
it
but
i
did
not
nor
of
anything
relating
to
it
but
i
dreamed
that
as
i
was
going
out
in
the
morning
as
usual
from
my
castle
i
saw
upon
the
shore
two
canoes
and
eleven
savages
coming
to
land
and
that
they
brought
with
them
another
savage
whom
they
were
going
to
kill
in
order
to
eat
him
when
on
a
sudden
the
savage
that
they
were
going
to
kill
jumped
away
and
ran
for
his
life
and
i
thought
in
my
sleep
that
he
came
running
into
my
little
thick
grove
before
my
fortification
to
hide
himself
and
that
i
seeing
him
alone
and
not
perceiving
that
the
others
sought
him
that
way
showed
myself
to
him
and
smiling
upon
him
encouraged
him
that
he
kneeled
down
to
me
seeming
to
pray
me
to
assist
him
upon
which
i
showed
him
my
ladder
made
him
go
up
and
carried
him
into
my
cave
and
he
became
my
servant
and
that
as
soon
as
i
had
got
this
man
i
said
to
myself
now
i
may
certainly
venture
to
the
mainland
for
this
fellow
will
serve
me
as
a
pilot
and
will
tell
me
what
to
do
and
whither
to
go
for
provisions
and
whither
not
to
go
for
fear
of
being
devoured
what
places
to
venture
into
and
what
to
shun
i
waked
with
this
thought
and
was
under
such
inexpressible
impressions
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
my
escape
in
my
dream
that
the
disappointments
which
i
felt
upon
coming
to
myself
and
finding
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
dream
were
equally
extravagant
the
other
way
and
threw
me
into
a
very
great
dejection
of
spirits
upon
this
however
i
made
this
conclusion
that
my
only
way
to
go
about
to
attempt
an
escape
was
to
endeavour
to
get
a
savage
into
my
possession
and
if
possible
it
should
be
one
of
their
prisoners
whom
they
had
condemned
to
be
eaten
and
should
bring
hither
to
kill
but
these
thoughts
still
were
attended
with
this
difficulty
that
it
was
impossible
to
effect
this
without
attacking
a
whole
caravan
of
them
and
killing
them
all
and
this
was
not
only
a
very
desperate
attempt
and
might
miscarry
but
on
the
other
hand
i
had
greatly
scrupled
the
lawfulness
of
it
to
myself
and
my
heart
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
shedding
so
much
blood
though
it
was
for
my
deliverance
i
need
not
repeat
the
arguments
which
occurred
to
me
against
this
they
being
the
same
mentioned
before
but
though
i
had
other
reasons
to
offer
now
viz
that
those
men
were
enemies
to
my
life
and
would
devour
me
if
they
could
that
it
was
self
preservation
in
the
highest
degree
to
deliver
myself
from
this
death
of
a
life
and
was
acting
in
my
own
defence
as
much
as
if
they
were
actually
assaulting
me
and
the
like
i
say
though
these
things
argued
for
it
yet
the
thoughts
of
shedding
human
blood
for
my
deliverance
were
very
terrible
to
me
and
such
as
i
could
by
no
means
reconcile
myself
to
for
a
great
while
however
at
last
after
many
secret
disputes
with
myself
and
after
great
perplexities
about
it
for
all
these
arguments
one
way
and
another
struggled
in
my
head
a
long
time
the
eager
prevailing
desire
of
deliverance
at
length
mastered
all
the
rest
and
i
resolved
if
possible
to
get
one
of
these
savages
into
my
hands
cost
what
it
would
my
next
thing
was
to
contrive
how
to
do
it
and
this
indeed
was
very
difficult
to
resolve
on
but
as
i
could
pitch
upon
no
probable
means
for
it
so
i
resolved
to
put
myself
upon
the
watch
to
see
them
when
they
came
on
shore
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
event
taking
such
measures
as
the
opportunity
should
present
let
what
would
be
with
these
resolutions
in
my
thoughts
i
set
myself
upon
the
scout
as
often
as
possible
and
indeed
so
often
that
i
was
heartily
tired
of
it
for
it
was
above
a
year
and
a
half
that
i
waited
and
for
great
part
of
that
time
went
out
to
the
west
end
and
to
the
south
west
corner
of
the
island
almost
every
day
to
look
for
canoes
but
none
appeared
this
was
very
discouraging
and
began
to
trouble
me
much
though
i
cannot
say
that
it
did
in
this
case
as
it
had
done
some
time
before
wear
off
the
edge
of
my
desire
to
the
thing
but
the
longer
it
seemed
to
be
delayed
the
more
eager
i
was
for
it
in
a
word
i
was
not
at
first
so
careful
to
shun
the
sight
of
these
savages
and
avoid
being
seen
by
them
as
i
was
now
eager
to
be
upon
them
besides
i
fancied
myself
able
to
manage
one
nay
two
or
three
savages
if
i
had
them
so
as
to
make
them
entirely
slaves
to
me
to
do
whatever
i
should
direct
them
and
to
prevent
their
being
able
at
any
time
to
do
me
any
hurt
it
was
a
great
while
that
i
pleased
myself
with
this
affair
but
nothing
still
presented
itself
all
my
fancies
and
schemes
came
to
nothing
for
no
savages
came
near
me
for
a
great
while
about
a
year
and
a
half
after
i
entertained
these
notions
and
by
long
musing
had
as
it
were
resolved
them
all
into
nothing
for
want
of
an
occasion
to
put
them
into
execution
i
was
surprised
one
morning
by
seeing
no
less
than
five
canoes
all
on
shore
together
on
my
side
the
island
and
the
people
who
belonged
to
them
all
landed
and
out
of
my
sight
the
number
of
them
broke
all
my
measures
for
seeing
so
many
and
knowing
that
they
always
came
four
or
six
or
sometimes
more
in
a
boat
i
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
or
how
to
take
my
measures
to
attack
twenty
or
thirty
men
single
handed
so
lay
still
in
my
castle
perplexed
and
discomforted
however
i
put
myself
into
the
same
position
for
an
attack
that
i
had
formerly
provided
and
was
just
ready
for
action
if
anything
had
presented
having
waited
a
good
while
listening
to
hear
if
they
made
any
noise
at
length
being
very
impatient
i
set
my
guns
at
the
foot
of
my
ladder
and
clambered
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
by
my
two
stages
as
usual
standing
so
however
that
my
head
did
not
appear
above
the
hill
so
that
they
could
not
perceive
me
by
any
means
here
i
observed
by
the
help
of
my
perspective
glass
that
they
were
no
less
than
thirty
in
number
that
they
had
a
fire
kindled
and
that
they
had
meat
dressed
how
they
had
cooked
it
i
knew
not
or
what
it
was
but
they
were
all
dancing
in
i
know
not
how
many
barbarous
gestures
and
figures
their
own
way
round
the
fire
while
i
was
thus
looking
on
them
i
perceived
by
my
perspective
two
miserable
wretches
dragged
from
the
boats
where
it
seems
they
were
laid
by
and
were
now
brought
out
for
the
slaughter
i
perceived
one
of
them
immediately
fall
being
knocked
down
i
suppose
with
a
club
or
wooden
sword
for
that
was
their
way
and
two
or
three
others
were
at
work
immediately
cutting
him
open
for
their
cookery
while
the
other
victim
was
left
standing
by
himself
till
they
should
be
ready
for
him
in
that
very
moment
this
poor
wretch
seeing
himself
a
little
at
liberty
and
unbound
nature
inspired
him
with
hopes
of
life
and
he
started
away
from
them
and
ran
with
incredible
swiftness
along
the
sands
directly
towards
me
i
mean
towards
that
part
of
the
coast
where
my
habitation
was
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
i
must
acknowledge
when
i
perceived
him
run
my
way
and
especially
when
as
i
thought
i
saw
him
pursued
by
the
whole
body
and
now
i
expected
that
part
of
my
dream
was
coming
to
pass
and
that
he
would
certainly
take
shelter
in
my
grove
but
i
could
not
depend
by
any
means
upon
my
dream
that
the
other
savages
would
not
pursue
him
thither
and
find
him
there
however
i
kept
my
station
and
my
spirits
began
to
recover
when
i
found
that
there
was
not
above
three
men
that
followed
him
and
still
more
was
i
encouraged
when
i
found
that
he
outstripped
them
exceedingly
in
running
and
gained
ground
on
them
so
that
if
he
could
but
hold
out
for
half
an
hour
i
saw
easily
he
would
fairly
get
away
from
them
all
there
was
between
them
and
my
castle
the
creek
which
i
mentioned
often
in
the
first
part
of
my
story
where
i
landed
my
cargoes
out
of
the
ship
and
this
i
saw
plainly
he
must
necessarily
swim
over
or
the
poor
wretch
would
be
taken
there
but
when
the
savage
escaping
came
thither
he
made
nothing
of
it
though
the
tide
was
then
up
but
plunging
in
swam
through
in
about
thirty
strokes
or
thereabouts
landed
and
ran
with
exceeding
strength
and
swiftness
when
the
three
persons
came
to
the
creek
i
found
that
two
of
them
could
swim
but
the
third
could
not
and
that
standing
on
the
other
side
he
looked
at
the
others
but
went
no
farther
and
soon
after
went
softly
back
again
which
as
it
happened
was
very
well
for
him
in
the
end
i
observed
that
the
two
who
swam
were
yet
more
than
twice
as
strong
swimming
over
the
creek
as
the
fellow
was
that
fled
from
them
it
came
very
warmly
upon
my
thoughts
and
indeed
irresistibly
that
now
was
the
time
to
get
me
a
servant
and
perhaps
a
companion
or
assistant
and
that
i
was
plainly
called
by
providence
to
save
this
poor
creature
s
life
i
immediately
ran
down
the
ladders
with
all
possible
expedition
fetched
my
two
guns
for
they
were
both
at
the
foot
of
the
ladders
as
i
observed
before
and
getting
up
again
with
the
same
haste
to
the
top
of
the
hill
i
crossed
towards
the
sea
and
having
a
very
short
cut
and
all
down
hill
placed
myself
in
the
way
between
the
pursuers
and
the
pursued
hallowing
aloud
to
him
that
fled
who
looking
back
was
at
first
perhaps
as
much
frightened
at
me
as
at
them
but
i
beckoned
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
back
and
in
the
meantime
i
slowly
advanced
towards
the
two
that
followed
then
rushing
at
once
upon
the
foremost
i
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
my
piece
i
was
loath
to
fire
because
i
would
not
have
the
rest
hear
though
at
that
distance
it
would
not
have
been
easily
heard
and
being
out
of
sight
of
the
smoke
too
they
would
not
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
having
knocked
this
fellow
down
the
other
who
pursued
him
stopped
as
if
he
had
been
frightened
and
i
advanced
towards
him
but
as
i
came
nearer
i
perceived
presently
he
had
a
bow
and
arrow
and
was
fitting
it
to
shoot
at
me
so
i
was
then
obliged
to
shoot
at
him
first
which
i
did
and
killed
him
at
the
first
shot
the
poor
savage
who
fled
but
had
stopped
though
he
saw
both
his
enemies
fallen
and
killed
as
he
thought
yet
was
so
frightened
with
the
fire
and
noise
of
my
piece
that
he
stood
stock
still
and
neither
came
forward
nor
went
backward
though
he
seemed
rather
inclined
still
to
fly
than
to
come
on
i
hallooed
again
to
him
and
made
signs
to
come
forward
which
he
easily
understood
and
came
a
little
way
then
stopped
again
and
then
a
little
farther
and
stopped
again
and
i
could
then
perceive
that
he
stood
trembling
as
if
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
had
just
been
to
be
killed
as
his
two
enemies
were
i
beckoned
to
him
again
to
come
to
me
and
gave
him
all
the
signs
of
encouragement
that
i
could
think
of
and
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
kneeling
down
every
ten
or
twelve
steps
in
token
of
acknowledgment
for
saving
his
life
i
smiled
at
him
and
looked
pleasantly
and
beckoned
to
him
to
come
still
nearer
at
length
he
came
close
to
me
and
then
he
kneeled
down
again
kissed
the
ground
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
ground
and
taking
me
by
the
foot
set
my
foot
upon
his
head
this
it
seems
was
in
token
of
swearing
to
be
my
slave
for
ever
i
took
him
up
and
made
much
of
him
and
encouraged
him
all
i
could
but
there
was
more
work
to
do
yet
for
i
perceived
the
savage
whom
i
had
knocked
down
was
not
killed
but
stunned
with
the
blow
and
began
to
come
to
himself
so
i
pointed
to
him
and
showed
him
the
savage
that
he
was
not
dead
upon
this
he
spoke
some
words
to
me
and
though
i
could
not
understand
them
yet
i
thought
they
were
pleasant
to
hear
for
they
were
the
first
sound
of
a
man
s
voice
that
i
had
heard
my
own
excepted
for
above
twenty
five
years
but
there
was
no
time
for
such
reflections
now
the
savage
who
was
knocked
down
recovered
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
up
upon
the
ground
and
i
perceived
that
my
savage
began
to
be
afraid
but
when
i
saw
that
i
presented
my
other
piece
at
the
man
as
if
i
would
shoot
him
upon
this
my
savage
for
so
i
call
him
now
made
a
motion
to
me
to
lend
him
my
sword
which
hung
naked
in
a
belt
by
my
side
which
i
did
he
no
sooner
had
it
but
he
runs
to
his
enemy
and
at
one
blow
cut
off
his
head
so
cleverly
no
executioner
in
germany
could
have
done
it
sooner
or
better
which
i
thought
very
strange
for
one
who
i
had
reason
to
believe
never
saw
a
sword
in
his
life
before
except
their
own
wooden
swords
however
it
seems
as
i
learned
afterwards
they
make
their
wooden
swords
so
sharp
so
heavy
and
the
wood
is
so
hard
that
they
will
even
cut
off
heads
with
them
ay
and
arms
and
that
at
one
blow
too
when
he
had
done
this
he
comes
laughing
to
me
in
sign
of
triumph
and
brought
me
the
sword
again
and
with
abundance
of
gestures
which
i
did
not
understand
laid
it
down
with
the
head
of
the
savage
that
he
had
killed
just
before
me
but
that
which
astonished
him
most
was
to
know
how
i
killed
the
other
indian
so
far
off
so
pointing
to
him
he
made
signs
to
me
to
let
him
go
to
him
and
i
bade
him
go
as
well
as
i
could
when
he
came
to
him
he
stood
like
one
amazed
looking
at
him
turning
him
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
looked
at
the
wound
the
bullet
had
made
which
it
seems
was
just
in
his
breast
where
it
had
made
a
hole
and
no
great
quantity
of
blood
had
followed
but
he
had
bled
inwardly
for
he
was
quite
dead
he
took
up
his
bow
and
arrows
and
came
back
so
i
turned
to
go
away
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
me
making
signs
to
him
that
more
might
come
after
them
upon
this
he
made
signs
to
me
that
he
should
bury
them
with
sand
that
they
might
not
be
seen
by
the
rest
if
they
followed
and
so
i
made
signs
to
him
again
to
do
so
he
fell
to
work
and
in
an
instant
he
had
scraped
a
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hands
big
enough
to
bury
the
first
in
and
then
dragged
him
into
it
and
covered
him
and
did
so
by
the
other
also
i
believe
he
had
him
buried
them
both
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
calling
away
i
carried
him
not
to
my
castle
but
quite
away
to
my
cave
on
the
farther
part
of
the
island
so
i
did
not
let
my
dream
come
to
pass
in
that
part
that
he
came
into
my
grove
for
shelter
here
i
gave
him
bread
and
a
bunch
of
raisins
to
eat
and
a
draught
of
water
which
i
found
he
was
indeed
in
great
distress
for
from
his
running
and
having
refreshed
him
i
made
signs
for
him
to
go
and
lie
down
to
sleep
showing
him
a
place
where
i
had
laid
some
rice
straw
and
a
blanket
upon
it
which
i
used
to
sleep
upon
myself
sometimes
so
the
poor
creature
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
he
was
a
comely
handsome
fellow
perfectly
well
made
with
straight
strong
limbs
not
too
large
tall
and
well
shaped
and
as
i
reckon
about
twenty
six
years
of
age
he
had
a
very
good
countenance
not
a
fierce
and
surly
aspect
but
seemed
to
have
something
very
manly
in
his
face
and
yet
he
had
all
the
sweetness
and
softness
of
a
european
in
his
countenance
too
especially
when
he
smiled
his
hair
was
long
and
black
not
curled
like
wool
his
forehead
very
high
and
large
and
a
great
vivacity
and
sparkling
sharpness
in
his
eyes
the
colour
of
his
skin
was
not
quite
black
but
very
tawny
and
yet
not
an
ugly
yellow
nauseous
tawny
as
the
brazilians
and
virginians
and
other
natives
of
america
are
but
of
a
bright
kind
of
a
dun
olive
colour
that
had
in
it
something
very
agreeable
though
not
very
easy
to
describe
his
face
was
round
and
plump
his
nose
small
not
flat
like
the
negroes
a
very
good
mouth
thin
lips
and
his
fine
teeth
well
set
and
as
white
as
ivory
after
he
had
slumbered
rather
than
slept
about
half
an
hour
he
awoke
again
and
came
out
of
the
cave
to
me
for
i
had
been
milking
my
goats
which
i
had
in
the
enclosure
just
by
when
he
espied
me
he
came
running
to
me
laying
himself
down
again
upon
the
ground
with
all
the
possible
signs
of
an
humble
thankful
disposition
making
a
great
many
antic
gestures
to
show
it
at
last
he
lays
his
head
flat
upon
the
ground
close
to
my
foot
and
sets
my
other
foot
upon
his
head
as
he
had
done
before
and
after
this
made
all
the
signs
to
me
of
subjection
servitude
and
submission
imaginable
to
let
me
know
how
he
would
serve
me
so
long
as
he
lived
i
understood
him
in
many
things
and
let
him
know
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
him
in
a
little
time
i
began
to
speak
to
him
and
teach
him
to
speak
to
me
and
first
i
let
him
know
his
name
should
be
friday
which
was
the
day
i
saved
his
life
i
called
him
so
for
the
memory
of
the
time
i
likewise
taught
him
to
say
master
and
then
let
him
know
that
was
to
be
my
name
i
likewise
taught
him
to
say
yes
and
no
and
to
know
the
meaning
of
them
i
gave
him
some
milk
in
an
earthen
pot
and
let
him
see
me
drink
it
before
him
and
sop
my
bread
in
it
and
gave
him
a
cake
of
bread
to
do
the
like
which
he
quickly
complied
with
and
made
signs
that
it
was
very
good
for
him
i
kept
there
with
him
all
that
night
but
as
soon
as
it
was
day
i
beckoned
to
him
to
come
with
me
and
let
him
know
i
would
give
him
some
clothes
at
which
he
seemed
very
glad
for
he
was
stark
naked
as
we
went
by
the
place
where
he
had
buried
the
two
men
he
pointed
exactly
to
the
place
and
showed
me
the
marks
that
he
had
made
to
find
them
again
making
signs
to
me
that
we
should
dig
them
up
again
and
eat
them
at
this
i
appeared
very
angry
expressed
my
abhorrence
of
it
made
as
if
i
would
vomit
at
the
thoughts
of
it
and
beckoned
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
away
which
he
did
immediately
with
great
submission
i
then
led
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
see
if
his
enemies
were
gone
and
pulling
out
my
glass
i
looked
and
saw
plainly
the
place
where
they
had
been
but
no
appearance
of
them
or
their
canoes
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
gone
and
had
left
their
two
comrades
behind
them
without
any
search
after
them
but
i
was
not
content
with
this
discovery
but
having
now
more
courage
and
consequently
more
curiosity
i
took
my
man
friday
with
me
giving
him
the
sword
in
his
hand
with
the
bow
and
arrows
at
his
back
which
i
found
he
could
use
very
dexterously
making
him
carry
one
gun
for
me
and
i
two
for
myself
and
away
we
marched
to
the
place
where
these
creatures
had
been
for
i
had
a
mind
now
to
get
some
further
intelligence
of
them
when
i
came
to
the
place
my
very
blood
ran
chill
in
my
veins
and
my
heart
sunk
within
me
at
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
indeed
it
was
a
dreadful
sight
at
least
it
was
so
to
me
though
friday
made
nothing
of
it
the
place
was
covered
with
human
bones
the
ground
dyed
with
their
blood
and
great
pieces
of
flesh
left
here
and
there
half
eaten
mangled
and
scorched
and
in
short
all
the
tokens
of
the
triumphant
feast
they
had
been
making
there
after
a
victory
over
their
enemies
i
saw
three
skulls
five
hands
and
the
bones
of
three
or
four
legs
and
feet
and
abundance
of
other
parts
of
the
bodies
and
friday
by
his
signs
made
me
understand
that
they
brought
over
four
prisoners
to
feast
upon
that
three
of
them
were
eaten
up
and
that
he
pointing
to
himself
was
the
fourth
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
between
them
and
their
next
king
of
whose
subjects
it
seems
he
had
been
one
and
that
they
had
taken
a
great
number
of
prisoners
all
which
were
carried
to
several
places
by
those
who
had
taken
them
in
the
fight
in
order
to
feast
upon
them
as
was
done
here
by
these
wretches
upon
those
they
brought
hither
i
caused
friday
to
gather
all
the
skulls
bones
flesh
and
whatever
remained
and
lay
them
together
in
a
heap
and
make
a
great
fire
upon
it
and
burn
them
all
to
ashes
i
found
friday
had
still
a
hankering
stomach
after
some
of
the
flesh
and
was
still
a
cannibal
in
his
nature
but
i
showed
so
much
abhorrence
at
the
very
thoughts
of
it
and
at
the
least
appearance
of
it
that
he
durst
not
discover
it
for
i
had
by
some
means
let
him
know
that
i
would
kill
him
if
he
offered
it
when
he
had
done
this
we
came
back
to
our
castle
and
there
i
fell
to
work
for
my
man
friday
and
first
of
all
i
gave
him
a
pair
of
linen
drawers
which
i
had
out
of
the
poor
gunner
s
chest
i
mentioned
which
i
found
in
the
wreck
and
which
with
a
little
alteration
fitted
him
very
well
and
then
i
made
him
a
jerkin
of
goat
s
skin
as
well
as
my
skill
would
allow
for
i
was
now
grown
a
tolerably
good
tailor
and
i
gave
him
a
cap
which
i
made
of
hare
s
skin
very
convenient
and
fashionable
enough
and
thus
he
was
clothed
for
the
present
tolerably
well
and
was
mighty
well
pleased
to
see
himself
almost
as
well
clothed
as
his
master
it
is
true
he
went
awkwardly
in
these
clothes
at
first
wearing
the
drawers
was
very
awkward
to
him
and
the
sleeves
of
the
waistcoat
galled
his
shoulders
and
the
inside
of
his
arms
but
a
little
easing
them
where
he
complained
they
hurt
him
and
using
himself
to
them
he
took
to
them
at
length
very
well
the
next
day
after
i
came
home
to
my
hutch
with
him
i
began
to
consider
where
i
should
lodge
him
and
that
i
might
do
well
for
him
and
yet
be
perfectly
easy
myself
i
made
a
little
tent
for
him
in
the
vacant
place
between
my
two
fortifications
in
the
inside
of
the
last
and
in
the
outside
of
the
first
as
there
was
a
door
or
entrance
there
into
my
cave
i
made
a
formal
framed
door
case
and
a
door
to
it
of
boards
and
set
it
up
in
the
passage
a
little
within
the
entrance
and
causing
the
door
to
open
in
the
inside
i
barred
it
up
in
the
night
taking
in
my
ladders
too
so
that
friday
could
no
way
come
at
me
in
the
inside
of
my
innermost
wall
without
making
so
much
noise
in
getting
over
that
it
must
needs
awaken
me
for
my
first
wall
had
now
a
complete
roof
over
it
of
long
poles
covering
all
my
tent
and
leaning
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
which
was
again
laid
across
with
smaller
sticks
instead
of
laths
and
then
thatched
over
a
great
thickness
with
the
rice
straw
which
was
strong
like
reeds
and
at
the
hole
or
place
which
was
left
to
go
in
or
out
by
the
ladder
i
had
placed
a
kind
of
trap
door
which
if
it
had
been
attempted
on
the
outside
would
not
have
opened
at
all
but
would
have
fallen
down
and
made
a
great
noise
as
to
weapons
i
took
them
all
into
my
side
every
night
but
i
needed
none
of
all
this
precaution
for
never
man
had
a
more
faithful
loving
sincere
servant
than
friday
was
to
me
without
passions
sullenness
or
designs
perfectly
obliged
and
engaged
his
very
affections
were
tied
to
me
like
those
of
a
child
to
a
father
and
i
daresay
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
life
to
save
mine
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
the
many
testimonies
he
gave
me
of
this
put
it
out
of
doubt
and
soon
convinced
me
that
i
needed
to
use
no
precautions
for
my
safety
on
his
account
this
frequently
gave
me
occasion
to
observe
and
that
with
wonder
that
however
it
had
pleased
god
in
his
providence
and
in
the
government
of
the
works
of
his
hands
to
take
from
so
great
a
part
of
the
world
of
his
creatures
the
best
uses
to
which
their
faculties
and
the
powers
of
their
souls
are
adapted
yet
that
he
has
bestowed
upon
them
the
same
powers
the
same
reason
the
same
affections
the
same
sentiments
of
kindness
and
obligation
the
same
passions
and
resentments
of
wrongs
the
same
sense
of
gratitude
sincerity
fidelity
and
all
the
capacities
of
doing
good
and
receiving
good
that
he
has
given
to
us
and
that
when
he
pleases
to
offer
them
occasions
of
exerting
these
they
are
as
ready
nay
more
ready
to
apply
them
to
the
right
uses
for
which
they
were
bestowed
than
we
are
this
made
me
very
melancholy
sometimes
in
reflecting
as
the
several
occasions
presented
how
mean
a
use
we
make
of
all
these
even
though
we
have
these
powers
enlightened
by
the
great
lamp
of
instruction
the
spirit
of
god
and
by
the
knowledge
of
his
word
added
to
our
understanding
and
why
it
has
pleased
god
to
hide
the
like
saving
knowledge
from
so
many
millions
of
souls
who
if
i
might
judge
by
this
poor
savage
would
make
a
much
better
use
of
it
than
we
did
from
hence
i
sometimes
was
led
too
far
to
invade
the
sovereignty
of
providence
and
as
it
were
arraign
the
justice
of
so
arbitrary
a
disposition
of
things
that
should
hide
that
sight
from
some
and
reveal
it
to
others
and
yet
expect
a
like
duty
from
both
but
i
shut
it
up
and
checked
my
thoughts
with
this
conclusion
first
that
we
did
not
know
by
what
light
and
law
these
should
be
condemned
but
that
as
god
was
necessarily
and
by
the
nature
of
his
being
infinitely
holy
and
just
so
it
could
not
be
but
if
these
creatures
were
all
sentenced
to
absence
from
himself
it
was
on
account
of
sinning
against
that
light
which
as
the
scripture
says
was
a
law
to
themselves
and
by
such
rules
as
their
consciences
would
acknowledge
to
be
just
though
the
foundation
was
not
discovered
to
us
and
secondly
that
still
as
we
all
are
the
clay
in
the
hand
of
the
potter
no
vessel
could
say
to
him
why
hast
thou
formed
me
thus
but
to
return
to
my
new
companion
i
was
greatly
delighted
with
him
and
made
it
my
business
to
teach
him
everything
that
was
proper
to
make
him
useful
handy
and
helpful
but
especially
to
make
him
speak
and
understand
me
when
i
spoke
and
he
was
the
aptest
scholar
that
ever
was
and
particularly
was
so
merry
so
constantly
diligent
and
so
pleased
when
he
could
but
understand
me
or
make
me
understand
him
that
it
was
very
pleasant
for
me
to
talk
to
him
now
my
life
began
to
be
so
easy
that
i
began
to
say
to
myself
that
could
i
but
have
been
safe
from
more
savages
i
cared
not
if
i
was
never
to
remove
from
the
place
where
i
lived
chapter
xv
friday
s
education
after
i
had
been
two
or
three
days
returned
to
my
castle
i
thought
that
in
order
to
bring
friday
off
from
his
horrid
way
of
feeding
and
from
the
relish
of
a
cannibal
s
stomach
i
ought
to
let
him
taste
other
flesh
so
i
took
him
out
with
me
one
morning
to
the
woods
i
went
indeed
intending
to
kill
a
kid
out
of
my
own
flock
and
bring
it
home
and
dress
it
but
as
i
was
going
i
saw
a
she
goat
lying
down
in
the
shade
and
two
young
kids
sitting
by
her
i
catched
hold
of
friday
hold
said
i
stand
still
and
made
signs
to
him
not
to
stir
immediately
i
presented
my
piece
shot
and
killed
one
of
the
kids
the
poor
creature
who
had
at
a
distance
indeed
seen
me
kill
the
savage
his
enemy
but
did
not
know
nor
could
imagine
how
it
was
done
was
sensibly
surprised
trembled
and
shook
and
looked
so
amazed
that
i
thought
he
would
have
sunk
down
he
did
not
see
the
kid
i
shot
at
or
perceive
i
had
killed
it
but
ripped
up
his
waistcoat
to
feel
whether
he
was
not
wounded
and
as
i
found
presently
thought
i
was
resolved
to
kill
him
for
he
came
and
kneeled
down
to
me
and
embracing
my
knees
said
a
great
many
things
i
did
not
understand
but
i
could
easily
see
the
meaning
was
to
pray
me
not
to
kill
him
i
soon
found
a
way
to
convince
him
that
i
would
do
him
no
harm
and
taking
him
up
by
the
hand
laughed
at
him
and
pointing
to
the
kid
which
i
had
killed
beckoned
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
it
which
he
did
and
while
he
was
wondering
and
looking
to
see
how
the
creature
was
killed
i
loaded
my
gun
again
by
and
by
i
saw
a
great
fowl
like
a
hawk
sitting
upon
a
tree
within
shot
so
to
let
friday
understand
a
little
what
i
would
do
i
called
him
to
me
again
pointed
at
the
fowl
which
was
indeed
a
parrot
though
i
thought
it
had
been
a
hawk
i
say
pointing
to
the
parrot
and
to
my
gun
and
to
the
ground
under
the
parrot
to
let
him
see
i
would
make
it
fall
i
made
him
understand
that
i
would
shoot
and
kill
that
bird
accordingly
i
fired
and
bade
him
look
and
immediately
he
saw
the
parrot
fall
he
stood
like
one
frightened
again
notwithstanding
all
i
had
said
to
him
and
i
found
he
was
the
more
amazed
because
he
did
not
see
me
put
anything
into
the
gun
but
thought
that
there
must
be
some
wonderful
fund
of
death
and
destruction
in
that
thing
able
to
kill
man
beast
bird
or
anything
near
or
far
off
and
the
astonishment
this
created
in
him
was
such
as
could
not
wear
off
for
a
long
time
and
i
believe
if
i
would
have
let
him
he
would
have
worshipped
me
and
my
gun
as
for
the
gun
itself
he
would
not
so
much
as
touch
it
for
several
days
after
but
he
would
speak
to
it
and
talk
to
it
as
if
it
had
answered
him
when
he
was
by
himself
which
as
i
afterwards
learned
of
him
was
to
desire
it
not
to
kill
him
well
after
his
astonishment
was
a
little
over
at
this
i
pointed
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
the
bird
i
had
shot
which
he
did
but
stayed
some
time
for
the
parrot
not
being
quite
dead
had
fluttered
away
a
good
distance
from
the
place
where
she
fell
however
he
found
her
took
her
up
and
brought
her
to
me
and
as
i
had
perceived
his
ignorance
about
the
gun
before
i
took
this
advantage
to
charge
the
gun
again
and
not
to
let
him
see
me
do
it
that
i
might
be
ready
for
any
other
mark
that
might
present
but
nothing
more
offered
at
that
time
so
i
brought
home
the
kid
and
the
same
evening
i
took
the
skin
off
and
cut
it
out
as
well
as
i
could
and
having
a
pot
fit
for
that
purpose
i
boiled
or
stewed
some
of
the
flesh
and
made
some
very
good
broth
after
i
had
begun
to
eat
some
i
gave
some
to
my
man
who
seemed
very
glad
of
it
and
liked
it
very
well
but
that
which
was
strangest
to
him
was
to
see
me
eat
salt
with
it
he
made
a
sign
to
me
that
the
salt
was
not
good
to
eat
and
putting
a
little
into
his
own
mouth
he
seemed
to
nauseate
it
and
would
spit
and
sputter
at
it
washing
his
mouth
with
fresh
water
after
it
on
the
other
hand
i
took
some
meat
into
my
mouth
without
salt
and
i
pretended
to
spit
and
sputter
for
want
of
salt
as
much
as
he
had
done
at
the
salt
but
it
would
not
do
he
would
never
care
for
salt
with
meat
or
in
his
broth
at
least
not
for
a
great
while
and
then
but
a
very
little
having
thus
fed
him
with
boiled
meat
and
broth
i
was
resolved
to
feast
him
the
next
day
by
roasting
a
piece
of
the
kid
this
i
did
by
hanging
it
before
the
fire
on
a
string
as
i
had
seen
many
people
do
in
england
setting
two
poles
up
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
and
one
across
the
top
and
tying
the
string
to
the
cross
stick
letting
the
meat
turn
continually
this
friday
admired
very
much
but
when
he
came
to
taste
the
flesh
he
took
so
many
ways
to
tell
me
how
well
he
liked
it
that
i
could
not
but
understand
him
and
at
last
he
told
me
as
well
as
he
could
he
would
never
eat
man
s
flesh
any
more
which
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
the
next
day
i
set
him
to
work
beating
some
corn
out
and
sifting
it
in
the
manner
i
used
to
do
as
i
observed
before
and
he
soon
understood
how
to
do
it
as
well
as
i
especially
after
he
had
seen
what
the
meaning
of
it
was
and
that
it
was
to
make
bread
of
for
after
that
i
let
him
see
me
make
my
bread
and
bake
it
too
and
in
a
little
time
friday
was
able
to
do
all
the
work
for
me
as
well
as
i
could
do
it
myself
i
began
now
to
consider
that
having
two
mouths
to
feed
instead
of
one
i
must
provide
more
ground
for
my
harvest
and
plant
a
larger
quantity
of
corn
than
i
used
to
do
so
i
marked
out
a
larger
piece
of
land
and
began
the
fence
in
the
same
manner
as
before
in
which
friday
worked
not
only
very
willingly
and
very
hard
but
did
it
very
cheerfully
and
i
told
him
what
it
was
for
that
it
was
for
corn
to
make
more
bread
because
he
was
now
with
me
and
that
i
might
have
enough
for
him
and
myself
too
he
appeared
very
sensible
of
that
part
and
let
me
know
that
he
thought
i
had
much
more
labour
upon
me
on
his
account
than
i
had
for
myself
and
that
he
would
work
the
harder
for
me
if
i
would
tell
him
what
to
do
this
was
the
pleasantest
year
of
all
the
life
i
led
in
this
place
friday
began
to
talk
pretty
well
and
understand
the
names
of
almost
everything
i
had
occasion
to
call
for
and
of
every
place
i
had
to
send
him
to
and
talked
a
great
deal
to
me
so
that
in
short
i
began
now
to
have
some
use
for
my
tongue
again
which
indeed
i
had
very
little
occasion
for
before
besides
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
him
i
had
a
singular
satisfaction
in
the
fellow
himself
his
simple
unfeigned
honesty
appeared
to
me
more
and
more
every
day
and
i
began
really
to
love
the
creature
and
on
his
side
i
believe
he
loved
me
more
than
it
was
possible
for
him
ever
to
love
anything
before
i
had
a
mind
once
to
try
if
he
had
any
inclination
for
his
own
country
again
and
having
taught
him
english
so
well
that
he
could
answer
me
almost
any
question
i
asked
him
whether
the
nation
that
he
belonged
to
never
conquered
in
battle
at
which
he
smiled
and
said
yes
yes
we
always
fight
the
better
that
is
he
meant
always
get
the
better
in
fight
and
so
we
began
the
following
discourse
master
you
always
fight
the
better
how
came
you
to
be
taken
prisoner
then
friday
friday
my
nation
beat
much
for
all
that
master
how
beat
if
your
nation
beat
them
how
came
you
to
be
taken
friday
they
more
many
than
my
nation
in
the
place
where
me
was
they
take
one
two
three
and
me
my
nation
over
beat
them
in
the
yonder
place
where
me
no
was
there
my
nation
take
one
two
great
thousand
master
but
why
did
not
your
side
recover
you
from
the
hands
of
your
enemies
then
friday
they
run
one
two
three
and
me
and
make
go
in
the
canoe
my
nation
have
no
canoe
that
time
master
well
friday
and
what
does
your
nation
do
with
the
men
they
take

they
carry
them
away
and
eat
them
as
these
did
friday
yes
my
nation

mans
too

all
up
master
where
do
they
carry
them

to
other
place
where
they
think
master
do
they
come
hither
friday
yes
yes
they
come
hither
come
other
else
place
master
have
you
been
here
with
them
friday
yes
i
have
been
here
points
to
the
nw
side
of
the
island
which
it
seems
was
their
side
by
this
i
understood
that
my
man
friday
had
formerly
been
among
the
savages
who
used
to
come
on
shore
on
the
farther
part
of
the
island
on
the
same
man
eating
occasions
he
was
now
brought
for
and
some
time
after
when
i
took
the
courage
to
carry
him
to
that
side
being
the
same
i
formerly
mentioned
he
presently
knew
the
place
and
told
me
he
was
there
once
when
they
ate
up
twenty
men
two
women
and
one
child
he
could
not
tell
twenty
in
english
but
he
numbered
them
by
laying
so
many
stones
in
a
row
and
pointing
to
me
to
tell
them
over
i
have
told
this
passage
because
it
introduces
what
follows
that
after
this
discourse
i
had
with
him
i
asked
him
how
far
it
was
from
our
island
to
the
shore
and
whether
the
canoes
were
not
often
lost
he
told
me
there
was
no
danger
no
canoes
ever
lost
but
that
after
a
little
way
out
to
sea
there
was
a
current
and
wind
always
one
way
in
the
morning
the
other
in
the
afternoon
this
i
understood
to
be
no
more
than
the
sets
of
the
tide
as
going
out
or
coming
in
but
i
afterwards
understood
it
was
occasioned
by
the
great
draft
and
reflux
of
the
mighty
river
orinoco
in
the
mouth
or
gulf
of
which
river
as
i
found
afterwards
our
island
lay
and
that
this
land
which
i
perceived
to
be
w
and
nw
was
the
great
island
trinidad
on
the
north
point
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
i
asked
friday
a
thousand
questions
about
the
country
the
inhabitants
the
sea
the
coast
and
what
nations
were
near
he
told
me
all
he
knew
with
the
greatest
openness
imaginable
i
asked
him
the
names
of
the
several
nations
of
his
sort
of
people
but
could
get
no
other
name
than
caribs
from
whence
i
easily
understood
that
these
were
the
caribbees
which
our
maps
place
on
the
part
of
america
which
reaches
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
orinoco
to
guiana
and
onwards
to
st
martha
he
told
me
that
up
a
great
way
beyond
the
moon
that
was
beyond
the
setting
of
the
moon
which
must
be
west
from
their
country
there
dwelt
white
bearded
men
like
me
and
pointed
to
my
great
whiskers
which
i
mentioned
before
and
that
they
had
killed
much
mans
that
was
his
word
by
all
which
i
understood
he
meant
the
spaniards
whose
cruelties
in
america
had
been
spread
over
the
whole
country
and
were
remembered
by
all
the
nations
from
father
to
son
i
inquired
if
he
could
tell
me
how
i
might
go
from
this
island
and
get
among
those
white
men
he
told
me
yes
yes
you
may
go
in
two
canoe
i
could
not
understand
what
he
meant
or
make
him
describe
to
me
what
he
meant
by
two
canoe
till
at
last
with
great
difficulty
i
found
he
meant
it
must
be
in
a
large
boat
as
big
as
two
canoes
this
part
of
friday
s
discourse
i
began
to
relish
very
well
and
from
this
time
i
entertained
some
hopes
that
one
time
or
other
i
might
find
an
opportunity
to
make
my
escape
from
this
place
and
that
this
poor
savage
might
be
a
means
to
help
me
during
the
long
time
that
friday
had
now
been
with
me
and
that
he
began
to
speak
to
me
and
understand
me
i
was
not
wanting
to
lay
a
foundation
of
religious
knowledge
in
his
mind
particularly
i
asked
him
one
time
who
made
him
the
creature
did
not
understand
me
at
all
but
thought
i
had
asked
who
was
his
father
but
i
took
it
up
by
another
handle
and
asked
him
who
made
the
sea
the
ground
we
walked
on
and
the
hills
and
woods
he
told
me
it
was
one
benamuckee
that
lived
beyond
all
he
could
describe
nothing
of
this
great
person
but
that
he
was
very
old
much
older
he
said
than
the
sea
or
land
than
the
moon
or
the
stars
i
asked
him
then
if
this
old
person
had
made
all
things
why
did
not
all
things
worship
him
he
looked
very
grave
and
with
a
perfect
look
of
innocence
said
all
things
say
o
to
him
i
asked
him
if
the
people
who
die
in
his
country
went
away
anywhere
he
said
yes
they
all
went
to
benamuckee
then
i
asked
him
whether
those
they
eat
up
went
thither
too
he
said
yes
from
these
things
i
began
to
instruct
him
in
the
knowledge
of
the
true
god
i
told
him
that
the
great
maker
of
all
things
lived
up
there
pointing
up
towards
heaven
that
he
governed
the
world
by
the
same
power
and
providence
by
which
he
made
it
that
he
was
omnipotent
and
could
do
everything
for
us
give
everything
to
us
take
everything
from
us
and
thus
by
degrees
i
opened
his
eyes
he
listened
with
great
attention
and
received
with
pleasure
the
notion
of
jesus
christ
being
sent
to
redeem
us
and
of
the
manner
of
making
our
prayers
to
god
and
his
being
able
to
hear
us
even
in
heaven
he
told
me
one
day
that
if
our
god
could
hear
us
up
beyond
the
sun
he
must
needs
be
a
greater
god
than
their
benamuckee
who
lived
but
a
little
way
off
and
yet
could
not
hear
till
they
went
up
to
the
great
mountains
where
he
dwelt
to
speak
to
them
i
asked
him
if
ever
he
went
thither
to
speak
to
him
he
said
no
they
never
went
that
were
young
men
none
went
thither
but
the
old
men
whom
he
called
their
oowokakee
that
is
as
i
made
him
explain
to
me
their
religious
or
clergy
and
that
they
went
to
say
o
so
he
called
saying
prayers
and
then
came
back
and
told
them
what
benamuckee
said
by
this
i
observed
that
there
is
priestcraft
even
among
the
most
blinded
ignorant
pagans
in
the
world
and
the
policy
of
making
a
secret
of
religion
in
order
to
preserve
the
veneration
of
the
people
to
the
clergy
not
only
to
be
found
in
the
roman
but
perhaps
among
all
religions
in
the
world
even
among
the
most
brutish
and
barbarous
savages
i
endeavoured
to
clear
up
this
fraud
to
my
man
friday
and
told
him
that
the
pretence
of
their
old
men
going
up
to
the
mountains
to
say
o
to
their
god
benamuckee
was
a
cheat
and
their
bringing
word
from
thence
what
he
said
was
much
more
so
that
if
they
met
with
any
answer
or
spake
with
any
one
there
it
must
be
with
an
evil
spirit
and
then
i
entered
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
about
the
devil
the
origin
of
him
his
rebellion
against
god
his
enmity
to
man
the
reason
of
it
his
setting
himself
up
in
the
dark
parts
of
the
world
to
be
worshipped
instead
of
god
and
as
god
and
the
many
stratagems
he
made
use
of
to
delude
mankind
to
their
ruin
how
he
had
a
secret
access
to
our
passions
and
to
our
affections
and
to
adapt
his
snares
to
our
inclinations
so
as
to
cause
us
even
to
be
our
own
tempters
and
run
upon
our
destruction
by
our
own
choice
i
found
it
was
not
so
easy
to
imprint
right
notions
in
his
mind
about
the
devil
as
it
was
about
the
being
of
a
god
nature
assisted
all
my
arguments
to
evidence
to
him
even
the
necessity
of
a
great
first
cause
an
overruling
governing
power
a
secret
directing
providence
and
of
the
equity
and
justice
of
paying
homage
to
him
that
made
us
and
the
like
but
there
appeared
nothing
of
this
kind
in
the
notion
of
an
evil
spirit
of
his
origin
his
being
his
nature
and
above
all
of
his
inclination
to
do
evil
and
to
draw
us
in
to
do
so
too
and
the
poor
creature
puzzled
me
once
in
such
a
manner
by
a
question
merely
natural
and
innocent
that
i
scarce
knew
what
to
say
to
him
i
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
to
him
of
the
power
of
god
his
omnipotence
his
aversion
to
sin
his
being
a
consuming
fire
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
how
as
he
had
made
us
all
he
could
destroy
us
and
all
the
world
in
a
moment
and
he
listened
with
great
seriousness
to
me
all
the
while
after
this
i
had
been
telling
him
how
the
devil
was
god
s
enemy
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
used
all
his
malice
and
skill
to
defeat
the
good
designs
of
providence
and
to
ruin
the
kingdom
of
christ
in
the
world
and
the
like
well
says
friday
but
you
say
god
is
so
strong
so
great
is
he
not
much
strong
much
might
as
the
devil
yes
yes
says
i
friday
god
is
stronger
than
the
devil
god
is
above
the
devil
and
therefore
we
pray
to
god
to
tread
him
down
under
our
feet
and
enable
us
to
resist
his
temptations
and
quench
his
fiery
darts
but
says
he
again
if
god
much
stronger
much
might
as
the
wicked
devil
why
god
no
kill
the
devil
so
make
him
no
more
do
wicked
i
was
strangely
surprised
at
this
question
and
after
all
though
i
was
now
an
old
man
yet
i
was
but
a
young
doctor
and
ill
qualified
for
a
casuist
or
a
solver
of
difficulties
and
at
first
i
could
not
tell
what
to
say
so
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
said
but
he
was
too
earnest
for
an
answer
to
forget
his
question
so
that
he
repeated
it
in
the
very
same
broken
words
as
above
by
this
time
i
had
recovered
myself
a
little
and
i
said
god
will
at
last
punish
him
severely
he
is
reserved
for
the
judgment
and
is
to
be
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
to
dwell
with
everlasting
fire
this
did
not
satisfy
friday
but
he
returns
upon
me
repeating
my
words
reserve
at
last
me
no
understand
but
why
not
kill
the
devil
now
not
kill
great
ago
you
may
as
well
ask
me
said
i
why
god
does
not
kill
you
or
me
when
we
do
wicked
things
here
that
offend
him
we
are
preserved
to
repent
and
be
pardoned
he
mused
some
time
on
this
well
well
says
he
mighty
affectionately
that
well
so
you
i
devil
all
wicked
all
preserve
repent
god
pardon
all
here
i
was
run
down
again
by
him
to
the
last
degree
and
it
was
a
testimony
to
me
how
the
mere
notions
of
nature
though
they
will
guide
reasonable
creatures
to
the
knowledge
of
a
god
and
of
a
worship
or
homage
due
to
the
supreme
being
of
god
as
the
consequence
of
our
nature
yet
nothing
but
divine
revelation
can
form
the
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
and
of
redemption
purchased
for
us
of
a
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
and
of
an
intercessor
at
the
footstool
of
god
s
throne
i
say
nothing
but
a
revelation
from
heaven
can
form
these
in
the
soul
and
that
therefore
the
gospel
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
i
mean
the
word
of
god
and
the
spirit
of
god
promised
for
the
guide
and
sanctifier
of
his
people
are
the
absolutely
necessary
instructors
of
the
souls
of
men
in
the
saving
knowledge
of
god
and
the
means
of
salvation
i
therefore
diverted
the
present
discourse
between
me
and
my
man
rising
up
hastily
as
upon
some
sudden
occasion
of
going
out
then
sending
him
for
something
a
good
way
off
i
seriously
prayed
to
god
that
he
would
enable
me
to
instruct
savingly
this
poor
savage
assisting
by
his
spirit
the
heart
of
the
poor
ignorant
creature
to
receive
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
god
in
christ
reconciling
him
to
himself
and
would
guide
me
so
to
speak
to
him
from
the
word
of
god
that
his
conscience
might
be
convinced
his
eyes
opened
and
his
soul
saved
when
he
came
again
to
me
i
entered
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
upon
the
subject
of
the
redemption
of
man
by
the
saviour
of
the
world
and
of
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
preached
from
heaven
viz
of
repentance
towards
god
and
faith
in
our
blessed
lord
jesus
i
then
explained
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
why
our
blessed
redeemer
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angels
but
the
seed
of
abraham
and
how
for
that
reason
the
fallen
angels
had
no
share
in
the
redemption
that
he
came
only
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
and
the
like
i
had
god
knows
more
sincerity
than
knowledge
in
all
the
methods
i
took
for
this
poor
creature
s
instruction
and
must
acknowledge
what
i
believe
all
that
act
upon
the
same
principle
will
find
that
in
laying
things
open
to
him
i
really
informed
and
instructed
myself
in
many
things
that
either
i
did
not
know
or
had
not
fully
considered
before
but
which
occurred
naturally
to
my
mind
upon
searching
into
them
for
the
information
of
this
poor
savage
and
i
had
more
affection
in
my
inquiry
after
things
upon
this
occasion
than
ever
i
felt
before
so
that
whether
this
poor
wild
wretch
was
better
for
me
or
no
i
had
great
reason
to
be
thankful
that
ever
he
came
to
me
my
grief
sat
lighter
upon
me
my
habitation
grew
comfortable
to
me
beyond
measure
and
when
i
reflected
that
in
this
solitary
life
which
i
have
been
confined
to
i
had
not
only
been
moved
to
look
up
to
heaven
myself
and
to
seek
the
hand
that
had
brought
me
here
but
was
now
to
be
made
an
instrument
under
providence
to
save
the
life
and
for
aught
i
knew
the
soul
of
a
poor
savage
and
bring
him
to
the
true
knowledge
of
religion
and
of
the
christian
doctrine
that
he
might
know
christ
jesus
in
whom
is
life
eternal
i
say
when
i
reflected
upon
all
these
things
a
secret
joy
ran
through
every
part
of
my
soul
and
i
frequently
rejoiced
that
ever
i
was
brought
to
this
place
which
i
had
so
often
thought
the
most
dreadful
of
all
afflictions
that
could
possibly
have
befallen
me
i
continued
in
this
thankful
frame
all
the
remainder
of
my
time
and
the
conversation
which
employed
the
hours
between
friday
and
me
was
such
as
made
the
three
years
which
we
lived
there
together
perfectly
and
completely
happy
if
any
such
thing
as
complete
happiness
can
be
formed
in
a
sublunary
state
this
savage
was
now
a
good
christian
a
much
better
than
i
though
i
have
reason
to
hope
and
bless
god
for
it
that
we
were
equally
penitent
and
comforted
restored
penitents
we
had
here
the
word
of
god
to
read
and
no
farther
off
from
his
spirit
to
instruct
than
if
we
had
been
in
england
i
always
applied
myself
in
reading
the
scripture
to
let
him
know
as
well
as
i
could
the
meaning
of
what
i
read
and
he
again
by
his
serious
inquiries
and
questionings
made
me
as
i
said
before
a
much
better
scholar
in
the
scripture
knowledge
than
i
should
ever
have
been
by
my
own
mere
private
reading
another
thing
i
cannot
refrain
from
observing
here
also
from
experience
in
this
retired
part
of
my
life
viz
how
infinite
and
inexpressible
a
blessing
it
is
that
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
christ
jesus
is
so
plainly
laid
down
in
the
word
of
god
so
easy
to
be
received
and
understood
that
as
the
bare
reading
the
scripture
made
me
capable
of
understanding
enough
of
my
duty
to
carry
me
directly
on
to
the
great
work
of
sincere
repentance
for
my
sins
and
laying
hold
of
a
saviour
for
life
and
salvation
to
a
stated
reformation
in
practice
and
obedience
to
all
god
s
commands
and
this
without
any
teacher
or
instructor
i
mean
human
so
the
same
plain
instruction
sufficiently
served
to
the
enlightening
this
savage
creature
and
bringing
him
to
be
such
a
christian
as
i
have
known
few
equal
to
him
in
my
life
as
to
all
the
disputes
wrangling
strife
and
contention
which
have
happened
in
the
world
about
religion
whether
niceties
in
doctrines
or
schemes
of
church
government
they
were
all
perfectly
useless
to
us
and
for
aught
i
can
yet
see
they
have
been
so
to
the
rest
of
the
world
we
had
the
sure
guide
to
heaven
viz
the
word
of
god
and
we
had
blessed
be
god
comfortable
views
of
the
spirit
of
god
teaching
and
instructing
by
his
word
leading
us
into
all
truth
and
making
us
both
willing
and
obedient
to
the
instruction
of
his
word
and
i
cannot
see
the
least
use
that
the
greatest
knowledge
of
the
disputed
points
of
religion
which
have
made
such
confusion
in
the
world
would
have
been
to
us
if
we
could
have
obtained
it
but
i
must
go
on
with
the
historical
part
of
things
and
take
every
part
in
its
order
after
friday
and
i
became
more
intimately
acquainted
and
that
he
could
understand
almost
all
i
said
to
him
and
speak
pretty
fluently
though
in
broken
english
to
me
i
acquainted
him
with
my
own
history
or
at
least
so
much
of
it
as
related
to
my
coming
to
this
place
how
i
had
lived
there
and
how
long
i
let
him
into
the
mystery
for
such
it
was
to
him
of
gunpowder
and
bullet
and
taught
him
how
to
shoot
i
gave
him
a
knife
which
he
was
wonderfully
delighted
with
and
i
made
him
a
belt
with
a
frog
hanging
to
it
such
as
in
england
we
wear
hangers
in
and
in
the
frog
instead
of
a
hanger
i
gave
him
a
hatchet
which
was
not
only
as
good
a
weapon
in
some
cases
but
much
more
useful
upon
other
occasions
i
described
to
him
the
country
of
europe
particularly
england
which
i
came
from
how
we
lived
how
we
worshipped
god
how
we
behaved
to
one
another
and
how
we
traded
in
ships
to
all
parts
of
the
world
i
gave
him
an
account
of
the
wreck
which
i
had
been
on
board
of
and
showed
him
as
near
as
i
could
the
place
where
she
lay
but
she
was
all
beaten
in
pieces
before
and
gone
i
showed
him
the
ruins
of
our
boat
which
we
lost
when
we
escaped
and
which
i
could
not
stir
with
my
whole
strength
then
but
was
now
fallen
almost
all
to
pieces
upon
seeing
this
boat
friday
stood
musing
a
great
while
and
said
nothing
i
asked
him
what
it
was
he
studied
upon
at
last
says
he
me
see
such
boat
like
come
to
place
at
my
nation
i
did
not
understand
him
a
good
while
but
at
last
when
i
had
examined
further
into
it
i
understood
by
him
that
a
boat
such
as
that
had
been
came
on
shore
upon
the
country
where
he
lived
that
is
as
he
explained
it
was
driven
thither
by
stress
of
weather
i
presently
imagined
that
some
european
ship
must
have
been
cast
away
upon
their
coast
and
the
boat
might
get
loose
and
drive
ashore
but
was
so
dull
that
i
never
once
thought
of
men
making
their
escape
from
a
wreck
thither
much
less
whence
they
might
come
so
i
only
inquired
after
a
description
of
the
boat
friday
described
the
boat
to
me
well
enough
but
brought
me
better
to
understand
him
when
he
added
with
some
warmth
we
save
the
white
mans
from
drown
then
i
presently
asked
if
there
were
any
white
mans
as
he
called
them
in
the
boat
yes
he
said
the
boat
full
of
white
mans
i
asked
him
how
many
he
told
upon
his
fingers
seventeen
i
asked
him
then
what
became
of
them
he
told
me
they
live
they
dwell
at
my
nation
this
put
new
thoughts
into
my
head
for
i
presently
imagined
that
these
might
be
the
men
belonging
to
the
ship
that
was
cast
away
in
the
sight
of
my
island
as
i
now
called
it
and
who
after
the
ship
was
struck
on
the
rock
and
they
saw
her
inevitably
lost
had
saved
themselves
in
their
boat
and
were
landed
upon
that
wild
shore
among
the
savages
upon
this
i
inquired
of
him
more
critically
what
was
become
of
them
he
assured
me
they
lived
still
there
that
they
had
been
there
about
four
years
that
the
savages
left
them
alone
and
gave
them
victuals
to
live
on
i
asked
him
how
it
came
to
pass
they
did
not
kill
them
and
eat
them
he
said
no
they
make
brother
with
them
that
is
as
i
understood
him
a
truce
and
then
he
added
they
no
eat
mans
but
when
make
the
war
fight
that
is
to
say
they
never
eat
any
men
but
such
as
come
to
fight
with
them
and
are
taken
in
battle
it
was
after
this
some
considerable
time
that
being
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
at
the
east
side
of
the
island
from
whence
as
i
have
said
i
had
in
a
clear
day
discovered
the
main
or
continent
of
america
friday
the
weather
being
very
serene
looks
very
earnestly
towards
the
mainland
and
in
a
kind
of
surprise
falls
a
jumping
and
dancing
and
calls
out
to
me
for
i
was
at
some
distance
from
him
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
oh
joy
says
he
oh
glad
there
see
my
country
there
my
nation
i
observed
an
extraordinary
sense
of
pleasure
appeared
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
countenance
discovered
a
strange
eagerness
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
in
his
own
country
again
this
observation
of
mine
put
a
great
many
thoughts
into
me
which
made
me
at
first
not
so
easy
about
my
new
man
friday
as
i
was
before
and
i
made
no
doubt
but
that
if
friday
could
get
back
to
his
own
nation
again
he
would
not
only
forget
all
his
religion
but
all
his
obligation
to
me
and
would
be
forward
enough
to
give
his
countrymen
an
account
of
me
and
come
back
perhaps
with
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
and
make
a
feast
upon
me
at
which
he
might
be
as
merry
as
he
used
to
be
with
those
of
his
enemies
when
they
were
taken
in
war
but
i
wronged
the
poor
honest
creature
very
much
for
which
i
was
very
sorry
afterwards
however
as
my
jealousy
increased
and
held
some
weeks
i
was
a
little
more
circumspect
and
not
so
familiar
and
kind
to
him
as
before
in
which
i
was
certainly
wrong
too
the
honest
grateful
creature
having
no
thought
about
it
but
what
consisted
with
the
best
principles
both
as
a
religious
christian
and
as
a
grateful
friend
as
appeared
afterwards
to
my
full
satisfaction
while
my
jealousy
of
him
lasted
you
may
be
sure
i
was
every
day
pumping
him
to
see
if
he
would
discover
any
of
the
new
thoughts
which
i
suspected
were
in
him
but
i
found
everything
he
said
was
so
honest
and
so
innocent
that
i
could
find
nothing
to
nourish
my
suspicion
and
in
spite
of
all
my
uneasiness
he
made
me
at
last
entirely
his
own
again
nor
did
he
in
the
least
perceive
that
i
was
uneasy
and
therefore
i
could
not
suspect
him
of
deceit
one
day
walking
up
the
same
hill
but
the
weather
being
hazy
at
sea
so
that
we
could
not
see
the
continent
i
called
to
him
and
said
friday
do
not
you
wish
yourself
in
your
own
country
your
own
nation
yes
he
said
i
be
much
o
glad
to
be
at
my
own
nation
what
would
you
do
there
said
i
would
you
turn
wild
again
eat
men
s
flesh
again
and
be
a
savage
as
you
were
before
he
looked
full
of
concern
and
shaking
his
head
said
no
no
friday
tell
them
to
live
good
tell
them
to
pray
god
tell
them
to
eat
corn
bread
cattle
flesh
milk
no
eat
man
again
why
then
said
i
to
him
they
will
kill
you
he
looked
grave
at
that
and
then
said
no
no
they
no
kill
me
they
willing
love
learn
he
meant
by
this
they
would
be
willing
to
learn
he
added
they
learned
much
of
the
bearded
mans
that
came
in
the
boat
then
i
asked
him
if
he
would
go
back
to
them
he
smiled
at
that
and
told
me
that
he
could
not
swim
so
far
i
told
him
i
would
make
a
canoe
for
him
he
told
me
he
would
go
if
i
would
go
with
him
i
go
says
i
why
they
will
eat
me
if
i
come
there
no
no
says
he
me
make
they
no
eat
you
me
make
they
much
love
you
he
meant
he
would
tell
them
how
i
had
killed
his
enemies
and
saved
his
life
and
so
he
would
make
them
love
me
then
he
told
me
as
well
as
he
could
how
kind
they
were
to
seventeen
white
men
or
bearded
men
as
he
called
them
who
came
on
shore
there
in
distress
from
this
time
i
confess
i
had
a
mind
to
venture
over
and
see
if
i
could
possibly
join
with
those
bearded
men
who
i
made
no
doubt
were
spaniards
and
portuguese
not
doubting
but
if
i
could
we
might
find
some
method
to
escape
from
thence
being
upon
the
continent
and
a
good
company
together
better
than
i
could
from
an
island
forty
miles
off
the
shore
alone
and
without
help
so
after
some
days
i
took
friday
to
work
again
by
way
of
discourse
and
told
him
i
would
give
him
a
boat
to
go
back
to
his
own
nation
and
accordingly
i
carried
him
to
my
frigate
which
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
having
cleared
it
of
water
for
i
always
kept
it
sunk
in
water
i
brought
it
out
showed
it
him
and
we
both
went
into
it
i
found
he
was
a
most
dexterous
fellow
at
managing
it
and
would
make
it
go
almost
as
swift
again
as
i
could
so
when
he
was
in
i
said
to
him
well
now
friday
shall
we
go
to
your
nation
he
looked
very
dull
at
my
saying
so
which
it
seems
was
because
he
thought
the
boat
was
too
small
to
go
so
far
i
then
told
him
i
had
a
bigger
so
the
next
day
i
went
to
the
place
where
the
first
boat
lay
which
i
had
made
but
which
i
could
not
get
into
the
water
he
said
that
was
big
enough
but
then
as
i
had
taken
no
care
of
it
and
it
had
lain
two
or
three
and
twenty
years
there
the
sun
had
so
split
and
dried
it
that
it
was
rotten
friday
told
me
such
a
boat
would
do
very
well
and
would
carry
much
enough
vittle
drink
bread
this
was
his
way
of
talking
chapter
xvi
rescue
of
prisoners
from
cannibals
upon
the
whole
i
was
by
this
time
so
fixed
upon
my
design
of
going
over
with
him
to
the
continent
that
i
told
him
we
would
go
and
make
one
as
big
as
that
and
he
should
go
home
in
it
he
answered
not
one
word
but
looked
very
grave
and
sad
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
asked
me
again
why
you
angry
mad
with
friday
what
me
done
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
i
told
him
i
was
not
angry
with
him
at
all
no
angry
says
he
repeating
the
words
several
times
why
send
friday
home
away
to
my
nation
why
says
i
friday
did
not
you
say
you
wished
you
were
there
yes
yes
says
he
wish
we
both
there
no
wish
friday
there
no
master
there
in
a
word
he
would
not
think
of
going
there
without
me
i
go
there
friday
says
i
what
shall
i
do
there
he
turned
very
quick
upon
me
at
this
you
do
great
deal
much
good
says
he
you
teach
wild
mans
be
good
sober
tame
mans
you
tell
them
know
god
pray
god
and
live
new
life
alas
friday
says
i
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
sayest
i
am
but
an
ignorant
man
myself
yes
yes
says
he
you
teachee
me
good
you
teachee
them
good
no
no
friday
says
i
you
shall
go
without
me
leave
me
here
to
live
by
myself
as
i
did
before
he
looked
confused
again
at
that
word
and
running
to
one
of
the
hatchets
which
he
used
to
wear
he
takes
it
up
hastily
and
gives
it
to
me
what
must
i
do
with
this
says
i
to
him
you
take
kill
friday
says
he
what
must
kill
you
for
said
i
again
he
returns
very
quick
what
you
send
friday
away
for
take
kill
friday
no
send
friday
away
this
he
spoke
so
earnestly
that
i
saw
tears
stand
in
his
eyes
in
a
word
i
so
plainly
discovered
the
utmost
affection
in
him
to
me
and
a
firm
resolution
in
him
that
i
told
him
then
and
often
after
that
i
would
never
send
him
away
from
me
if
he
was
willing
to
stay
with
me
upon
the
whole
as
i
found
by
all
his
discourse
a
settled
affection
to
me
and
that
nothing
could
part
him
from
me
so
i
found
all
the
foundation
of
his
desire
to
go
to
his
own
country
was
laid
in
his
ardent
affection
to
the
people
and
his
hopes
of
my
doing
them
good
a
thing
which
as
i
had
no
notion
of
myself
so
i
had
not
the
least
thought
or
intention
or
desire
of
undertaking
it
but
still
i
found
a
strong
inclination
to
attempting
my
escape
founded
on
the
supposition
gathered
from
the
discourse
that
there
were
seventeen
bearded
men
there
and
therefore
without
any
more
delay
i
went
to
work
with
friday
to
find
out
a
great
tree
proper
to
fell
and
make
a
large
periagua
or
canoe
to
undertake
the
voyage
there
were
trees
enough
in
the
island
to
have
built
a
little
fleet
not
of
periaguas
or
canoes
but
even
of
good
large
vessels
but
the
main
thing
i
looked
at
was
to
get
one
so
near
the
water
that
we
might
launch
it
when
it
was
made
to
avoid
the
mistake
i
committed
at
first
at
last
friday
pitched
upon
a
tree
for
i
found
he
knew
much
better
than
i
what
kind
of
wood
was
fittest
for
it
nor
can
i
tell
to
this
day
what
wood
to
call
the
tree
we
cut
down
except
that
it
was
very
like
the
tree
we
call
fustic
or
between
that
and
the
nicaragua
wood
for
it
was
much
of
the
same
colour
and
smell
friday
wished
to
burn
the
hollow
or
cavity
of
this
tree
out
to
make
it
for
a
boat
but
i
showed
him
how
to
cut
it
with
tools
which
after
i
had
showed
him
how
to
use
he
did
very
handily
and
in
about
a
month
s
hard
labour
we
finished
it
and
made
it
very
handsome
especially
when
with
our
axes
which
i
showed
him
how
to
handle
we
cut
and
hewed
the
outside
into
the
true
shape
of
a
boat
after
this
however
it
cost
us
near
a
fortnight
s
time
to
get
her
along
as
it
were
inch
by
inch
upon
great
rollers
into
the
water
but
when
she
was
in
she
would
have
carried
twenty
men
with
great
ease
when
she
was
in
the
water
though
she
was
so
big
it
amazed
me
to
see
with
what
dexterity
and
how
swift
my
man
friday
could
manage
her
turn
her
and
paddle
her
along
so
i
asked
him
if
he
would
and
if
we
might
venture
over
in
her
yes
he
said
we
venture
over
in
her
very
well
though
great
blow
wind
however
i
had
a
further
design
that
he
knew
nothing
of
and
that
was
to
make
a
mast
and
a
sail
and
to
fit
her
with
an
anchor
and
cable
as
to
a
mast
that
was
easy
enough
to
get
so
i
pitched
upon
a
straight
young
cedar
tree
which
i
found
near
the
place
and
which
there
were
great
plenty
of
in
the
island
and
i
set
friday
to
work
to
cut
it
down
and
gave
him
directions
how
to
shape
and
order
it
but
as
to
the
sail
that
was
my
particular
care
i
knew
i
had
old
sails
or
rather
pieces
of
old
sails
enough
but
as
i
had
had
them
now
six
and
twenty
years
by
me
and
had
not
been
very
careful
to
preserve
them
not
imagining
that
i
should
ever
have
this
kind
of
use
for
them
i
did
not
doubt
but
they
were
all
rotten
and
indeed
most
of
them
were
so
however
i
found
two
pieces
which
appeared
pretty
good
and
with
these
i
went
to
work
and
with
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
awkward
stitching
you
may
be
sure
for
want
of
needles
i
at
length
made
a
three
cornered
ugly
thing
like
what
we
call
in
england
a
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
to
go
with
a
boom
at
bottom
and
a
little
short
sprit
at
the
top
such
as
usually
our
ships
long
boats
sail
with
and
such
as
i
best
knew
how
to
manage
as
it
was
such
a
one
as
i
had
to
the
boat
in
which
i
made
my
escape
from
barbary
as
related
in
the
first
part
of
my
story
i
was
near
two
months
performing
this
last
work
viz
rigging
and
fitting
my
masts
and
sails
for
i
finished
them
very
complete
making
a
small
stay
and
a
sail
or
foresail
to
it
to
assist
if
we
should
turn
to
windward
and
what
was
more
than
all
i
fixed
a
rudder
to
the
stern
of
her
to
steer
with
i
was
but
a
bungling
shipwright
yet
as
i
knew
the
usefulness
and
even
necessity
of
such
a
thing
i
applied
myself
with
so
much
pains
to
do
it
that
at
last
i
brought
it
to
pass
though
considering
the
many
dull
contrivances
i
had
for
it
that
failed
i
think
it
cost
me
almost
as
much
labour
as
making
the
boat
after
all
this
was
done
i
had
my
man
friday
to
teach
as
to
what
belonged
to
the
navigation
of
my
boat
though
he
knew
very
well
how
to
paddle
a
canoe
he
knew
nothing
of
what
belonged
to
a
sail
and
a
rudder
and
was
the
most
amazed
when
he
saw
me
work
the
boat
to
and
again
in
the
sea
by
the
rudder
and
how
the
sail
jibed
and
filled
this
way
or
that
way
as
the
course
we
sailed
changed
i
say
when
he
saw
this
he
stood
like
one
astonished
and
amazed
however
with
a
little
use
i
made
all
these
things
familiar
to
him
and
he
became
an
expert
sailor
except
that
of
the
compass
i
could
make
him
understand
very
little
on
the
other
hand
as
there
was
very
little
cloudy
weather
and
seldom
or
never
any
fogs
in
those
parts
there
was
the
less
occasion
for
a
compass
seeing
the
stars
were
always
to
be
seen
by
night
and
the
shore
by
day
except
in
the
rainy
seasons
and
then
nobody
cared
to
stir
abroad
either
by
land
or
sea
i
was
now
entered
on
the
seven
and
twentieth
year
of
my
captivity
in
this
place
though
the
three
last
years
that
i
had
this
creature
with
me
ought
rather
to
be
left
out
of
the
account
my
habitation
being
quite
of
another
kind
than
in
all
the
rest
of
the
time
i
kept
the
anniversary
of
my
landing
here
with
the
same
thankfulness
to
god
for
his
mercies
as
at
first
and
if
i
had
such
cause
of
acknowledgment
at
first
i
had
much
more
so
now
having
such
additional
testimonies
of
the
care
of
providence
over
me
and
the
great
hopes
i
had
of
being
effectually
and
speedily
delivered
for
i
had
an
invincible
impression
upon
my
thoughts
that
my
deliverance
was
at
hand
and
that
i
should
not
be
another
year
in
this
place
i
went
on
however
with
my
husbandry
digging
planting
and
fencing
as
usual
i
gathered
and
cured
my
grapes
and
did
every
necessary
thing
as
before
the
rainy
season
was
in
the
meantime
upon
me
when
i
kept
more
within
doors
than
at
other
times
we
had
stowed
our
new
vessel
as
secure
as
we
could
bringing
her
up
into
the
creek
where
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
i
landed
my
rafts
from
the
ship
and
hauling
her
up
to
the
shore
at
high
water
mark
i
made
my
man
friday
dig
a
little
dock
just
big
enough
to
hold
her
and
just
deep
enough
to
give
her
water
enough
to
float
in
and
then
when
the
tide
was
out
we
made
a
strong
dam
across
the
end
of
it
to
keep
the
water
out
and
so
she
lay
dry
as
to
the
tide
from
the
sea
and
to
keep
the
rain
off
we
laid
a
great
many
boughs
of
trees
so
thick
that
she
was
as
well
thatched
as
a
house
and
thus
we
waited
for
the
months
of
november
and
december
in
which
i
designed
to
make
my
adventure
when
the
settled
season
began
to
come
in
as
the
thought
of
my
design
returned
with
the
fair
weather
i
was
preparing
daily
for
the
voyage
and
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
lay
by
a
certain
quantity
of
provisions
being
the
stores
for
our
voyage
and
intended
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
s
time
to
open
the
dock
and
launch
out
our
boat
i
was
busy
one
morning
upon
something
of
this
kind
when
i
called
to
friday
and
bid
him
to
go
to
the
sea
shore
and
see
if
he
could
find
a
turtle
or
a
tortoise
a
thing
which
we
generally
got
once
a
week
for
the
sake
of
the
eggs
as
well
as
the
flesh
friday
had
not
been
long
gone
when
he
came
running
back
and
flew
over
my
outer
wall
or
fence
like
one
that
felt
not
the
ground
or
the
steps
he
set
his
foot
on
and
before
i
had
time
to
speak
to
him
he
cries
out
to
me
o
master
o
master
o
sorrow
o
bad
what
s
the
matter
friday
says
i
o
yonder
there
says
he
one
two
three
canoes
one
two
three
by
this
way
of
speaking
i
concluded
there
were
six
but
on
inquiry
i
found
there
were
but
three
well
friday
says
i
do
not
be
frightened
so
i
heartened
him
up
as
well
as
i
could
however
i
saw
the
poor
fellow
was
most
terribly
scared
for
nothing
ran
in
his
head
but
that
they
were
come
to
look
for
him
and
would
cut
him
in
pieces
and
eat
him
and
the
poor
fellow
trembled
so
that
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
with
him
i
comforted
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
told
him
i
was
in
as
much
danger
as
he
and
that
they
would
eat
me
as
well
as
him
but
says
i
friday
we
must
resolve
to
fight
them
can
you
fight
friday
me
shoot
says
he
but
there
come
many
great
number
no
matter
for
that
said
i
again
our
guns
will
fright
them
that
we
do
not
kill
so
i
asked
him
whether
if
i
resolved
to
defend
him
he
would
defend
me
and
stand
by
me
and
do
just
as
i
bid
him
he
said
me
die
when
you
bid
die
master
so
i
went
and
fetched
a
good
dram
of
rum
and
gave
him
for
i
had
been
so
good
a
husband
of
my
rum
that
i
had
a
great
deal
left
when
we
had
drunk
it
i
made
him
take
the
two
fowling
pieces
which
we
always
carried
and
loaded
them
with
large
swan
shot
as
big
as
small
pistol
bullets
then
i
took
four
muskets
and
loaded
them
with
two
slugs
and
five
small
bullets
each
and
my
two
pistols
i
loaded
with
a
brace
of
bullets
each
i
hung
my
great
sword
as
usual
naked
by
my
side
and
gave
friday
his
hatchet
when
i
had
thus
prepared
myself
i
took
my
perspective
glass
and
went
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
to
see
what
i
could
discover
and
i
found
quickly
by
my
glass
that
there
were
one
and
twenty
savages
three
prisoners
and
three
canoes
and
that
their
whole
business
seemed
to
be
the
triumphant
banquet
upon
these
three
human
bodies
a
barbarous
feast
indeed
but
nothing
more
than
as
i
had
observed
was
usual
with
them
i
observed
also
that
they
had
landed
not
where
they
had
done
when
friday
made
his
escape
but
nearer
to
my
creek
where
the
shore
was
low
and
where
a
thick
wood
came
almost
close
down
to
the
sea
this
with
the
abhorrence
of
the
inhuman
errand
these
wretches
came
about
filled
me
with
such
indignation
that
i
came
down
again
to
friday
and
told
him
i
was
resolved
to
go
down
to
them
and
kill
them
all
and
asked
him
if
he
would
stand
by
me
he
had
now
got
over
his
fright
and
his
spirits
being
a
little
raised
with
the
dram
i
had
given
him
he
was
very
cheerful
and
told
me
as
before
he
would
die
when
i
bid
die
in
this
fit
of
fury
i
divided
the
arms
which
i
had
charged
as
before
between
us
i
gave
friday
one
pistol
to
stick
in
his
girdle
and
three
guns
upon
his
shoulder
and
i
took
one
pistol
and
the
other
three
guns
myself
and
in
this
posture
we
marched
out
i
took
a
small
bottle
of
rum
in
my
pocket
and
gave
friday
a
large
bag
with
more
powder
and
bullets
and
as
to
orders
i
charged
him
to
keep
close
behind
me
and
not
to
stir
or
shoot
or
do
anything
till
i
bid
him
and
in
the
meantime
not
to
speak
a
word
in
this
posture
i
fetched
a
compass
to
my
right
hand
of
near
a
mile
as
well
to
get
over
the
creek
as
to
get
into
the
wood
so
that
i
could
come
within
shot
of
them
before
i
should
be
discovered
which
i
had
seen
by
my
glass
it
was
easy
to
do
while
i
was
making
this
march
my
former
thoughts
returning
i
began
to
abate
my
resolution
i
do
not
mean
that
i
entertained
any
fear
of
their
number
for
as
they
were
naked
unarmed
wretches
it
is
certain
i
was
superior
to
them
nay
though
i
had
been
alone
but
it
occurred
to
my
thoughts
what
call
what
occasion
much
less
what
necessity
i
was
in
to
go
and
dip
my
hands
in
blood
to
attack
people
who
had
neither
done
or
intended
me
any
wrong
who
as
to
me
were
innocent
and
whose
barbarous
customs
were
their
own
disaster
being
in
them
a
token
indeed
of
god
s
having
left
them
with
the
other
nations
of
that
part
of
the
world
to
such
stupidity
and
to
such
inhuman
courses
but
did
not
call
me
to
take
upon
me
to
be
a
judge
of
their
actions
much
less
an
executioner
of
his
justice
that
whenever
he
thought
fit
he
would
take
the
cause
into
his
own
hands
and
by
national
vengeance
punish
them
as
a
people
for
national
crimes
but
that
in
the
meantime
it
was
none
of
my
business
that
it
was
true
friday
might
justify
it
because
he
was
a
declared
enemy
and
in
a
state
of
war
with
those
very
particular
people
and
it
was
lawful
for
him
to
attack
them
but
i
could
not
say
the
same
with
regard
to
myself
these
things
were
so
warmly
pressed
upon
my
thoughts
all
the
way
as
i
went
that
i
resolved
i
would
only
go
and
place
myself
near
them
that
i
might
observe
their
barbarous
feast
and
that
i
would
act
then
as
god
should
direct
but
that
unless
something
offered
that
was
more
a
call
to
me
than
yet
i
knew
of
i
would
not
meddle
with
them
with
this
resolution
i
entered
the
wood
and
with
all
possible
wariness
and
silence
friday
following
close
at
my
heels
i
marched
till
i
came
to
the
skirts
of
the
wood
on
the
side
which
was
next
to
them
only
that
one
corner
of
the
wood
lay
between
me
and
them
here
i
called
softly
to
friday
and
showing
him
a
great
tree
which
was
just
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
i
bade
him
go
to
the
tree
and
bring
me
word
if
he
could
see
there
plainly
what
they
were
doing
he
did
so
and
came
immediately
back
to
me
and
told
me
they
might
be
plainly
viewed
there
that
they
were
all
about
their
fire
eating
the
flesh
of
one
of
their
prisoners
and
that
another
lay
bound
upon
the
sand
a
little
from
them
whom
he
said
they
would
kill
next
and
this
fired
the
very
soul
within
me
he
told
me
it
was
not
one
of
their
nation
but
one
of
the
bearded
men
he
had
told
me
of
that
came
to
their
country
in
the
boat
i
was
filled
with
horror
at
the
very
naming
of
the
white
bearded
man
and
going
to
the
tree
i
saw
plainly
by
my
glass
a
white
man
who
lay
upon
the
beach
of
the
sea
with
his
hands
and
his
feet
tied
with
flags
or
things
like
rushes
and
that
he
was
an
european
and
had
clothes
on
there
was
another
tree
and
a
little
thicket
beyond
it
about
fifty
yards
nearer
to
them
than
the
place
where
i
was
which
by
going
a
little
way
about
i
saw
i
might
come
at
undiscovered
and
that
then
i
should
be
within
half
a
shot
of
them
so
i
withheld
my
passion
though
i
was
indeed
enraged
to
the
highest
degree
and
going
back
about
twenty
paces
i
got
behind
some
bushes
which
held
all
the
way
till
i
came
to
the
other
tree
and
then
came
to
a
little
rising
ground
which
gave
me
a
full
view
of
them
at
the
distance
of
about
eighty
yards
i
had
now
not
a
moment
to
lose
for
nineteen
of
the
dreadful
wretches
sat
upon
the
ground
all
close
huddled
together
and
had
just
sent
the
other
two
to
butcher
the
poor
christian
and
bring
him
perhaps
limb
by
limb
to
their
fire
and
they
were
stooping
down
to
untie
the
bands
at
his
feet
i
turned
to
friday
now
friday
said
i
do
as
i
bid
thee
friday
said
he
would
then
friday
says
i
do
exactly
as
you
see
me
do
fail
in
nothing
so
i
set
down
one
of
the
muskets
and
the
fowling
piece
upon
the
ground
and
friday
did
the
like
by
his
and
with
the
other
musket
i
took
my
aim
at
the
savages
bidding
him
to
do
the
like
then
asking
him
if
he
was
ready
he
said
yes
then
fire
at
them
said
i
and
at
the
same
moment
i
fired
also
friday
took
his
aim
so
much
better
than
i
that
on
the
side
that
he
shot
he
killed
two
of
them
and
wounded
three
more
and
on
my
side
i
killed
one
and
wounded
two
they
were
you
may
be
sure
in
a
dreadful
consternation
and
all
of
them
that
were
not
hurt
jumped
upon
their
feet
but
did
not
immediately
know
which
way
to
run
or
which
way
to
look
for
they
knew
not
from
whence
their
destruction
came
friday
kept
his
eyes
close
upon
me
that
as
i
had
bid
him
he
might
observe
what
i
did
so
as
soon
as
the
first
shot
was
made
i
threw
down
the
piece
and
took
up
the
fowling
piece
and
friday
did
the
like
he
saw
me
cock
and
present
he
did
the
same
again
are
you
ready
friday
said
i
yes
says
he
let
fly
then
says
i
in
the
name
of
god
and
with
that
i
fired
again
among
the
amazed
wretches
and
so
did
friday
and
as
our
pieces
were
now
loaded
with
what
i
call
swan
shot
or
small
pistol
bullets
we
found
only
two
drop
but
so
many
were
wounded
that
they
ran
about
yelling
and
screaming
like
mad
creatures
all
bloody
and
most
of
them
miserably
wounded
whereof
three
more
fell
quickly
after
though
not
quite
dead
now
friday
says
i
laying
down
the
discharged
pieces
and
taking
up
the
musket
which
was
yet
loaded
follow
me
which
he
did
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
upon
which
i
rushed
out
of
the
wood
and
showed
myself
and
friday
close
at
my
foot
as
soon
as
i
perceived
they
saw
me
i
shouted
as
loud
as
i
could
and
bade
friday
do
so
too
and
running
as
fast
as
i
could
which
by
the
way
was
not
very
fast
being
loaded
with
arms
as
i
was
i
made
directly
towards
the
poor
victim
who
was
as
i
said
lying
upon
the
beach
or
shore
between
the
place
where
they
sat
and
the
sea
the
two
butchers
who
were
just
going
to
work
with
him
had
left
him
at
the
surprise
of
our
first
fire
and
fled
in
a
terrible
fright
to
the
seaside
and
had
jumped
into
a
canoe
and
three
more
of
the
rest
made
the
same
way
i
turned
to
friday
and
bade
him
step
forwards
and
fire
at
them
he
understood
me
immediately
and
running
about
forty
yards
to
be
nearer
them
he
shot
at
them
and
i
thought
he
had
killed
them
all
for
i
saw
them
all
fall
of
a
heap
into
the
boat
though
i
saw
two
of
them
up
again
quickly
however
he
killed
two
of
them
and
wounded
the
third
so
that
he
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
if
he
had
been
dead
while
my
man
friday
fired
at
them
i
pulled
out
my
knife
and
cut
the
flags
that
bound
the
poor
victim
and
loosing
his
hands
and
feet
i
lifted
him
up
and
asked
him
in
the
portuguese
tongue
what
he
was
he
answered
in
latin
christianus
but
was
so
weak
and
faint
that
he
could
scarce
stand
or
speak
i
took
my
bottle
out
of
my
pocket
and
gave
it
him
making
signs
that
he
should
drink
which
he
did
and
i
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
which
he
ate
then
i
asked
him
what
countryman
he
was
and
he
said
espagniole
and
being
a
little
recovered
let
me
know
by
all
the
signs
he
could
possibly
make
how
much
he
was
in
my
debt
for
his
deliverance
seignior
said
i
with
as
much
spanish
as
i
could
make
up
we
will
talk
afterwards
but
we
must
fight
now
if
you
have
any
strength
left
take
this
pistol
and
sword
and
lay
about
you
he
took
them
very
thankfully
and
no
sooner
had
he
the
arms
in
his
hands
but
as
if
they
had
put
new
vigour
into
him
he
flew
upon
his
murderers
like
a
fury
and
had
cut
two
of
them
in
pieces
in
an
instant
for
the
truth
is
as
the
whole
was
a
surprise
to
them
so
the
poor
creatures
were
so
much
frightened
with
the
noise
of
our
pieces
that
they
fell
down
for
mere
amazement
and
fear
and
had
no
more
power
to
attempt
their
own
escape
than
their
flesh
had
to
resist
our
shot
and
that
was
the
case
of
those
five
that
friday
shot
at
in
the
boat
for
as
three
of
them
fell
with
the
hurt
they
received
so
the
other
two
fell
with
the
fright
i
kept
my
piece
in
my
hand
still
without
firing
being
willing
to
keep
my
charge
ready
because
i
had
given
the
spaniard
my
pistol
and
sword
so
i
called
to
friday
and
bade
him
run
up
to
the
tree
from
whence
we
first
fired
and
fetch
the
arms
which
lay
there
that
had
been
discharged
which
he
did
with
great
swiftness
and
then
giving
him
my
musket
i
sat
down
myself
to
load
all
the
rest
again
and
bade
them
come
to
me
when
they
wanted
while
i
was
loading
these
pieces
there
happened
a
fierce
engagement
between
the
spaniard
and
one
of
the
savages
who
made
at
him
with
one
of
their
great
wooden
swords
the
weapon
that
was
to
have
killed
him
before
if
i
had
not
prevented
it
the
spaniard
who
was
as
bold
and
brave
as
could
be
imagined
though
weak
had
fought
the
indian
a
good
while
and
had
cut
two
great
wounds
on
his
head
but
the
savage
being
a
stout
lusty
fellow
closing
in
with
him
had
thrown
him
down
being
faint
and
was
wringing
my
sword
out
of
his
hand
when
the
spaniard
though
undermost
wisely
quitting
the
sword
drew
the
pistol
from
his
girdle
shot
the
savage
through
the
body
and
killed
him
upon
the
spot
before
i
who
was
running
to
help
him
could
come
near
him
friday
being
now
left
to
his
liberty
pursued
the
flying
wretches
with
no
weapon
in
his
hand
but
his
hatchet
and
with
that
he
despatched
those
three
who
as
i
said
before
were
wounded
at
first
and
fallen
and
all
the
rest
he
could
come
up
with
and
the
spaniard
coming
to
me
for
a
gun
i
gave
him
one
of
the
fowling
pieces
with
which
he
pursued
two
of
the
savages
and
wounded
them
both
but
as
he
was
not
able
to
run
they
both
got
from
him
into
the
wood
where
friday
pursued
them
and
killed
one
of
them
but
the
other
was
too
nimble
for
him
and
though
he
was
wounded
yet
had
plunged
himself
into
the
sea
and
swam
with
all
his
might
off
to
those
two
who
were
left
in
the
canoe
which
three
in
the
canoe
with
one
wounded
that
we
knew
not
whether
he
died
or
no
were
all
that
escaped
our
hands
of
one
and
twenty
the
account
of
the
whole
is
as
follows
three
killed
at
our
first
shot
from
the
tree
two
killed
at
the
next
shot
two
killed
by
friday
in
the
boat
two
killed
by
friday
of
those
at
first
wounded
one
killed
by
friday
in
the
wood
three
killed
by
the
spaniard
four
killed
being
found
dropped
here
and
there
of
the
wounds
or
killed
by
friday
in
his
chase
of
them
four
escaped
in
the
boat
whereof
one
wounded
if
not
dead
twenty
one
in
all
those
that
were
in
the
canoe
worked
hard
to
get
out
of
gun
shot
and
though
friday
made
two
or
three
shots
at
them
i
did
not
find
that
he
hit
any
of
them
friday
would
fain
have
had
me
take
one
of
their
canoes
and
pursue
them
and
indeed
i
was
very
anxious
about
their
escape
lest
carrying
the
news
home
to
their
people
they
should
come
back
perhaps
with
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
canoes
and
devour
us
by
mere
multitude
so
i
consented
to
pursue
them
by
sea
and
running
to
one
of
their
canoes
i
jumped
in
and
bade
friday
follow
me
but
when
i
was
in
the
canoe
i
was
surprised
to
find
another
poor
creature
lie
there
bound
hand
and
foot
as
the
spaniard
was
for
the
slaughter
and
almost
dead
with
fear
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
for
he
had
not
been
able
to
look
up
over
the
side
of
the
boat
he
was
tied
so
hard
neck
and
heels
and
had
been
tied
so
long
that
he
had
really
but
little
life
in
him
i
immediately
cut
the
twisted
flags
or
rushes
which
they
had
bound
him
with
and
would
have
helped
him
up
but
he
could
not
stand
or
speak
but
groaned
most
piteously
believing
it
seems
still
that
he
was
only
unbound
in
order
to
be
killed
when
friday
came
to
him
i
bade
him
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
of
his
deliverance
and
pulling
out
my
bottle
made
him
give
the
poor
wretch
a
dram
which
with
the
news
of
his
being
delivered
revived
him
and
he
sat
up
in
the
boat
but
when
friday
came
to
hear
him
speak
and
look
in
his
face
it
would
have
moved
any
one
to
tears
to
have
seen
how
friday
kissed
him
embraced
him
hugged
him
cried
laughed
hallooed
jumped
about
danced
sang
then
cried
again
wrung
his
hands
beat
his
own
face
and
head
and
then
sang
and
jumped
about
again
like
a
distracted
creature
it
was
a
good
while
before
i
could
make
him
speak
to
me
or
tell
me
what
was
the
matter
but
when
he
came
a
little
to
himself
he
told
me
that
it
was
his
father
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
express
how
it
moved
me
to
see
what
ecstasy
and
filial
affection
had
worked
in
this
poor
savage
at
the
sight
of
his
father
and
of
his
being
delivered
from
death
nor
indeed
can
i
describe
half
the
extravagances
of
his
affection
after
this
for
he
went
into
the
boat
and
out
of
the
boat
a
great
many
times
when
he
went
in
to
him
he
would
sit
down
by
him
open
his
breast
and
hold
his
father
s
head
close
to
his
bosom
for
many
minutes
together
to
nourish
it
then
he
took
his
arms
and
ankles
which
were
numbed
and
stiff
with
the
binding
and
chafed
and
rubbed
them
with
his
hands
and
i
perceiving
what
the
case
was
gave
him
some
rum
out
of
my
bottle
to
rub
them
with
which
did
them
a
great
deal
of
good
this
affair
put
an
end
to
our
pursuit
of
the
canoe
with
the
other
savages
who
were
now
almost
out
of
sight
and
it
was
happy
for
us
that
we
did
not
for
it
blew
so
hard
within
two
hours
after
and
before
they
could
be
got
a
quarter
of
their
way
and
continued
blowing
so
hard
all
night
and
that
from
the
north
west
which
was
against
them
that
i
could
not
suppose
their
boat
could
live
or
that
they
ever
reached
their
own
coast
but
to
return
to
friday
he
was
so
busy
about
his
father
that
i
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
take
him
off
for
some
time
but
after
i
thought
he
could
leave
him
a
little
i
called
him
to
me
and
he
came
jumping
and
laughing
and
pleased
to
the
highest
extreme
then
i
asked
him
if
he
had
given
his
father
any
bread
he
shook
his
head
and
said
none
ugly
dog
eat
all
up
self
i
then
gave
him
a
cake
of
bread
out
of
a
little
pouch
i
carried
on
purpose
i
also
gave
him
a
dram
for
himself
but
he
would
not
taste
it
but
carried
it
to
his
father
i
had
in
my
pocket
two
or
three
bunches
of
raisins
so
i
gave
him
a
handful
of
them
for
his
father
he
had
no
sooner
given
his
father
these
raisins
but
i
saw
him
come
out
of
the
boat
and
run
away
as
if
he
had
been
bewitched
for
he
was
the
swiftest
fellow
on
his
feet
that
ever
i
saw
i
say
he
ran
at
such
a
rate
that
he
was
out
of
sight
as
it
were
in
an
instant
and
though
i
called
and
hallooed
out
too
after
him
it
was
all
one
away
he
went
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
saw
him
come
back
again
though
not
so
fast
as
he
went
and
as
he
came
nearer
i
found
his
pace
slacker
because
he
had
something
in
his
hand
when
he
came
up
to
me
i
found
he
had
been
quite
home
for
an
earthen
jug
or
pot
to
bring
his
father
some
fresh
water
and
that
he
had
got
two
more
cakes
or
loaves
of
bread
the
bread
he
gave
me
but
the
water
he
carried
to
his
father
however
as
i
was
very
thirsty
too
i
took
a
little
of
it
the
water
revived
his
father
more
than
all
the
rum
or
spirits
i
had
given
him
for
he
was
fainting
with
thirst
when
his
father
had
drunk
i
called
to
him
to
know
if
there
was
any
water
left
he
said
yes
and
i
bade
him
give
it
to
the
poor
spaniard
who
was
in
as
much
want
of
it
as
his
father
and
i
sent
one
of
the
cakes
that
friday
brought
to
the
spaniard
too
who
was
indeed
very
weak
and
was
reposing
himself
upon
a
green
place
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
whose
limbs
were
also
very
stiff
and
very
much
swelled
with
the
rude
bandage
he
had
been
tied
with
when
i
saw
that
upon
friday
s
coming
to
him
with
the
water
he
sat
up
and
drank
and
took
the
bread
and
began
to
eat
i
went
to
him
and
gave
him
a
handful
of
raisins
he
looked
up
in
my
face
with
all
the
tokens
of
gratitude
and
thankfulness
that
could
appear
in
any
countenance
but
was
so
weak
notwithstanding
he
had
so
exerted
himself
in
the
fight
that
he
could
not
stand
up
upon
his
feet
he
tried
to
do
it
two
or
three
times
but
was
really
not
able
his
ankles
were
so
swelled
and
so
painful
to
him
so
i
bade
him
sit
still
and
caused
friday
to
rub
his
ankles
and
bathe
them
with
rum
as
he
had
done
his
father
s
i
observed
the
poor
affectionate
creature
every
two
minutes
or
perhaps
less
all
the
while
he
was
here
turn
his
head
about
to
see
if
his
father
was
in
the
same
place
and
posture
as
he
left
him
sitting
and
at
last
he
found
he
was
not
to
be
seen
at
which
he
started
up
and
without
speaking
a
word
flew
with
that
swiftness
to
him
that
one
could
scarce
perceive
his
feet
to
touch
the
ground
as
he
went
but
when
he
came
he
only
found
he
had
laid
himself
down
to
ease
his
limbs
so
friday
came
back
to
me
presently
and
then
i
spoke
to
the
spaniard
to
let
friday
help
him
up
if
he
could
and
lead
him
to
the
boat
and
then
he
should
carry
him
to
our
dwelling
where
i
would
take
care
of
him
but
friday
a
lusty
strong
fellow
took
the
spaniard
upon
his
back
and
carried
him
away
to
the
boat
and
set
him
down
softly
upon
the
side
or
gunnel
of
the
canoe
with
his
feet
in
the
inside
of
it
and
then
lifting
him
quite
in
he
set
him
close
to
his
father
and
presently
stepping
out
again
launched
the
boat
off
and
paddled
it
along
the
shore
faster
than
i
could
walk
though
the
wind
blew
pretty
hard
too
so
he
brought
them
both
safe
into
our
creek
and
leaving
them
in
the
boat
ran
away
to
fetch
the
other
canoe
as
he
passed
me
i
spoke
to
him
and
asked
him
whither
he
went
he
told
me
go
fetch
more
boat
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
for
sure
never
man
or
horse
ran
like
him
and
he
had
the
other
canoe
in
the
creek
almost
as
soon
as
i
got
to
it
by
land
so
he
wafted
me
over
and
then
went
to
help
our
new
guests
out
of
the
boat
which
he
did
but
they
were
neither
of
them
able
to
walk
so
that
poor
friday
knew
not
what
to
do
to
remedy
this
i
went
to
work
in
my
thought
and
calling
to
friday
to
bid
them
sit
down
on
the
bank
while
he
came
to
me
i
soon
made
a
kind
of
hand
barrow
to
lay
them
on
and
friday
and
i
carried
them
both
up
together
upon
it
between
us
but
when
we
got
them
to
the
outside
of
our
wall
or
fortification
we
were
at
a
worse
loss
than
before
for
it
was
impossible
to
get
them
over
and
i
was
resolved
not
to
break
it
down
so
i
set
to
work
again
and
friday
and
i
in
about
two
hours
time
made
a
very
handsome
tent
covered
with
old
sails
and
above
that
with
boughs
of
trees
being
in
the
space
without
our
outward
fence
and
between
that
and
the
grove
of
young
wood
which
i
had
planted
and
here
we
made
them
two
beds
of
such
things
as
i
had
viz
of
good
rice
straw
with
blankets
laid
upon
it
to
lie
on
and
another
to
cover
them
on
each
bed
my
island
was
now
peopled
and
i
thought
myself
very
rich
in
subjects
and
it
was
a
merry
reflection
which
i
frequently
made
how
like
a
king
i
looked
first
of
all
the
whole
country
was
my
own
property
so
that
i
had
an
undoubted
right
of
dominion
secondly
my
people
were
perfectly
subjected
i
was
absolutely
lord
and
lawgiver
they
all
owed
their
lives
to
me
and
were
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
if
there
had
been
occasion
for
it
for
me
it
was
remarkable
too
i
had
but
three
subjects
and
they
were
of
three
different
religions
my
man
friday
was
a
protestant
his
father
was
a
pagan
and
a
cannibal
and
the
spaniard
was
a
papist
however
i
allowed
liberty
of
conscience
throughout
my
dominions
but
this
is
by
the
way
as
soon
as
i
had
secured
my
two
weak
rescued
prisoners
and
given
them
shelter
and
a
place
to
rest
them
upon
i
began
to
think
of
making
some
provision
for
them
and
the
first
thing
i
did
i
ordered
friday
to
take
a
yearling
goat
betwixt
a
kid
and
a
goat
out
of
my
particular
flock
to
be
killed
when
i
cut
off
the
hinder
quarter
and
chopping
it
into
small
pieces
i
set
friday
to
work
to
boiling
and
stewing
and
made
them
a
very
good
dish
i
assure
you
of
flesh
and
broth
and
as
i
cooked
it
without
doors
for
i
made
no
fire
within
my
inner
wall
so
i
carried
it
all
into
the
new
tent
and
having
set
a
table
there
for
them
i
sat
down
and
ate
my
own
dinner
also
with
them
and
as
well
as
i
could
cheered
them
and
encouraged
them
friday
was
my
interpreter
especially
to
his
father
and
indeed
to
the
spaniard
too
for
the
spaniard
spoke
the
language
of
the
savages
pretty
well
after
we
had
dined
or
rather
supped
i
ordered
friday
to
take
one
of
the
canoes
and
go
and
fetch
our
muskets
and
other
firearms
which
for
want
of
time
we
had
left
upon
the
place
of
battle
and
the
next
day
i
ordered
him
to
go
and
bury
the
dead
bodies
of
the
savages
which
lay
open
to
the
sun
and
would
presently
be
offensive
i
also
ordered
him
to
bury
the
horrid
remains
of
their
barbarous
feast
which
i
could
not
think
of
doing
myself
nay
i
could
not
bear
to
see
them
if
i
went
that
way
all
which
he
punctually
performed
and
effaced
the
very
appearance
of
the
savages
being
there
so
that
when
i
went
again
i
could
scarce
know
where
it
was
otherwise
than
by
the
corner
of
the
wood
pointing
to
the
place
i
then
began
to
enter
into
a
little
conversation
with
my
two
new
subjects
and
first
i
set
friday
to
inquire
of
his
father
what
he
thought
of
the
escape
of
the
savages
in
that
canoe
and
whether
we
might
expect
a
return
of
them
with
a
power
too
great
for
us
to
resist
his
first
opinion
was
that
the
savages
in
the
boat
never
could
live
out
the
storm
which
blew
that
night
they
went
off
but
must
of
necessity
be
drowned
or
driven
south
to
those
other
shores
where
they
were
as
sure
to
be
devoured
as
they
were
to
be
drowned
if
they
were
cast
away
but
as
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
came
safe
on
shore
he
said
he
knew
not
but
it
was
his
opinion
that
they
were
so
dreadfully
frightened
with
the
manner
of
their
being
attacked
the
noise
and
the
fire
that
he
believed
they
would
tell
the
people
they
were
all
killed
by
thunder
and
lightning
not
by
the
hand
of
man
and
that
the
two
which
appeared
viz
friday
and
i
were
two
heavenly
spirits
or
furies
come
down
to
destroy
them
and
not
men
with
weapons
this
he
said
he
knew
because
he
heard
them
all
cry
out
so
in
their
language
one
to
another
for
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
conceive
that
a
man
could
dart
fire
and
speak
thunder
and
kill
at
a
distance
without
lifting
up
the
hand
as
was
done
now
and
this
old
savage
was
in
the
right
for
as
i
understood
since
by
other
hands
the
savages
never
attempted
to
go
over
to
the
island
afterwards
they
were
so
terrified
with
the
accounts
given
by
those
four
men
for
it
seems
they
did
escape
the
sea
that
they
believed
whoever
went
to
that
enchanted
island
would
be
destroyed
with
fire
from
the
gods
this
however
i
knew
not
and
therefore
was
under
continual
apprehensions
for
a
good
while
and
kept
always
upon
my
guard
with
all
my
army
for
as
there
were
now
four
of
us
i
would
have
ventured
upon
a
hundred
of
them
fairly
in
the
open
field
at
any
time
chapter
xvii
visit
of
mutineers
in
a
little
time
however
no
more
canoes
appearing
the
fear
of
their
coming
wore
off
and
i
began
to
take
my
former
thoughts
of
a
voyage
to
the
main
into
consideration
being
likewise
assured
by
friday
s
father
that
i
might
depend
upon
good
usage
from
their
nation
on
his
account
if
i
would
go
but
my
thoughts
were
a
little
suspended
when
i
had
a
serious
discourse
with
the
spaniard
and
when
i
understood
that
there
were
sixteen
more
of
his
countrymen
and
portuguese
who
having
been
cast
away
and
made
their
escape
to
that
side
lived
there
at
peace
indeed
with
the
savages
but
were
very
sore
put
to
it
for
necessaries
and
indeed
for
life
i
asked
him
all
the
particulars
of
their
voyage
and
found
they
were
a
spanish
ship
bound
from
the
rio
de
la
plata
to
the
havanna
being
directed
to
leave
their
loading
there
which
was
chiefly
hides
and
silver
and
to
bring
back
what
european
goods
they
could
meet
with
there
that
they
had
five
portuguese
seamen
on
board
whom
they
took
out
of
another
wreck
that
five
of
their
own
men
were
drowned
when
first
the
ship
was
lost
and
that
these
escaped
through
infinite
dangers
and
hazards
and
arrived
almost
starved
on
the
cannibal
coast
where
they
expected
to
have
been
devoured
every
moment
he
told
me
they
had
some
arms
with
them
but
they
were
perfectly
useless
for
that
they
had
neither
powder
nor
ball
the
washing
of
the
sea
having
spoiled
all
their
powder
but
a
little
which
they
used
at
their
first
landing
to
provide
themselves
with
some
food
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
would
become
of
them
there
and
if
they
had
formed
any
design
of
making
their
escape
he
said
they
had
many
consultations
about
it
but
that
having
neither
vessel
nor
tools
to
build
one
nor
provisions
of
any
kind
their
councils
always
ended
in
tears
and
despair
i
asked
him
how
he
thought
they
would
receive
a
proposal
from
me
which
might
tend
towards
an
escape
and
whether
if
they
were
all
here
it
might
not
be
done
i
told
him
with
freedom
i
feared
mostly
their
treachery
and
ill
usage
of
me
if
i
put
my
life
in
their
hands
for
that
gratitude
was
no
inherent
virtue
in
the
nature
of
man
nor
did
men
always
square
their
dealings
by
the
obligations
they
had
received
so
much
as
they
did
by
the
advantages
they
expected
i
told
him
it
would
be
very
hard
that
i
should
be
made
the
instrument
of
their
deliverance
and
that
they
should
afterwards
make
me
their
prisoner
in
new
spain
where
an
englishman
was
certain
to
be
made
a
sacrifice
what
necessity
or
what
accident
soever
brought
him
thither
and
that
i
had
rather
be
delivered
up
to
the
savages
and
be
devoured
alive
than
fall
into
the
merciless
claws
of
the
priests
and
be
carried
into
the
inquisition
i
added
that
otherwise
i
was
persuaded
if
they
were
all
here
we
might
with
so
many
hands
build
a
barque
large
enough
to
carry
us
all
away
either
to
the
brazils
southward
or
to
the
islands
or
spanish
coast
northward
but
that
if
in
requital
they
should
when
i
had
put
weapons
into
their
hands
carry
me
by
force
among
their
own
people
i
might
be
ill
used
for
my
kindness
to
them
and
make
my
case
worse
than
it
was
before
he
answered
with
a
great
deal
of
candour
and
ingenuousness
that
their
condition
was
so
miserable
and
that
they
were
so
sensible
of
it
that
he
believed
they
would
abhor
the
thought
of
using
any
man
unkindly
that
should
contribute
to
their
deliverance
and
that
if
i
pleased
he
would
go
to
them
with
the
old
man
and
discourse
with
them
about
it
and
return
again
and
bring
me
their
answer
that
he
would
make
conditions
with
them
upon
their
solemn
oath
that
they
should
be
absolutely
under
my
direction
as
their
commander
and
captain
and
they
should
swear
upon
the
holy
sacraments
and
gospel
to
be
true
to
me
and
go
to
such
christian
country
as
i
should
agree
to
and
no
other
and
to
be
directed
wholly
and
absolutely
by
my
orders
till
they
were
landed
safely
in
such
country
as
i
intended
and
that
he
would
bring
a
contract
from
them
under
their
hands
for
that
purpose
then
he
told
me
he
would
first
swear
to
me
himself
that
he
would
never
stir
from
me
as
long
as
he
lived
till
i
gave
him
orders
and
that
he
would
take
my
side
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
if
there
should
happen
the
least
breach
of
faith
among
his
countrymen
he
told
me
they
were
all
of
them
very
civil
honest
men
and
they
were
under
the
greatest
distress
imaginable
having
neither
weapons
nor
clothes
nor
any
food
but
at
the
mercy
and
discretion
of
the
savages
out
of
all
hopes
of
ever
returning
to
their
own
country
and
that
he
was
sure
if
i
would
undertake
their
relief
they
would
live
and
die
by
me
upon
these
assurances
i
resolved
to
venture
to
relieve
them
if
possible
and
to
send
the
old
savage
and
this
spaniard
over
to
them
to
treat
but
when
we
had
got
all
things
in
readiness
to
go
the
spaniard
himself
started
an
objection
which
had
so
much
prudence
in
it
on
one
hand
and
so
much
sincerity
on
the
other
hand
that
i
could
not
but
be
very
well
satisfied
in
it
and
by
his
advice
put
off
the
deliverance
of
his
comrades
for
at
least
half
a
year
the
case
was
thus
he
had
been
with
us
now
about
a
month
during
which
time
i
had
let
him
see
in
what
manner
i
had
provided
with
the
assistance
of
providence
for
my
support
and
he
saw
evidently
what
stock
of
corn
and
rice
i
had
laid
up
which
though
it
was
more
than
sufficient
for
myself
yet
it
was
not
sufficient
without
good
husbandry
for
my
family
now
it
was
increased
to
four
but
much
less
would
it
be
sufficient
if
his
countrymen
who
were
as
he
said
sixteen
still
alive
should
come
over
and
least
of
all
would
it
be
sufficient
to
victual
our
vessel
if
we
should
build
one
for
a
voyage
to
any
of
the
christian
colonies
of
america
so
he
told
me
he
thought
it
would
be
more
advisable
to
let
him
and
the
other
two
dig
and
cultivate
some
more
land
as
much
as
i
could
spare
seed
to
sow
and
that
we
should
wait
another
harvest
that
we
might
have
a
supply
of
corn
for
his
countrymen
when
they
should
come
for
want
might
be
a
temptation
to
them
to
disagree
or
not
to
think
themselves
delivered
otherwise
than
out
of
one
difficulty
into
another
you
know
says
he
the
children
of
israel
though
they
rejoiced
at
first
for
their
being
delivered
out
of
egypt
yet
rebelled
even
against
god
himself
that
delivered
them
when
they
came
to
want
bread
in
the
wilderness
his
caution
was
so
seasonable
and
his
advice
so
good
that
i
could
not
but
be
very
well
pleased
with
his
proposal
as
well
as
i
was
satisfied
with
his
fidelity
so
we
fell
to
digging
all
four
of
us
as
well
as
the
wooden
tools
we
were
furnished
with
permitted
and
in
about
a
month
s
time
by
the
end
of
which
it
was
seed
time
we
had
got
as
much
land
cured
and
trimmed
up
as
we
sowed
two
and
twenty
bushels
of
barley
on
and
sixteen
jars
of
rice
which
was
in
short
all
the
seed
we
had
to
spare
indeed
we
left
ourselves
barely
sufficient
for
our
own
food
for
the
six
months
that
we
had
to
expect
our
crop
that
is
to
say
reckoning
from
the
time
we
set
our
seed
aside
for
sowing
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
it
is
six
months
in
the
ground
in
that
country
having
now
society
enough
and
our
numbers
being
sufficient
to
put
us
out
of
fear
of
the
savages
if
they
had
come
unless
their
number
had
been
very
great
we
went
freely
all
over
the
island
whenever
we
found
occasion
and
as
we
had
our
escape
or
deliverance
upon
our
thoughts
it
was
impossible
at
least
for
me
to
have
the
means
of
it
out
of
mine
for
this
purpose
i
marked
out
several
trees
which
i
thought
fit
for
our
work
and
i
set
friday
and
his
father
to
cut
them
down
and
then
i
caused
the
spaniard
to
whom
i
imparted
my
thoughts
on
that
affair
to
oversee
and
direct
their
work
i
showed
them
with
what
indefatigable
pains
i
had
hewed
a
large
tree
into
single
planks
and
i
caused
them
to
do
the
like
till
they
made
about
a
dozen
large
planks
of
good
oak
near
two
feet
broad
thirty
five
feet
long
and
from
two
inches
to
four
inches
thick
what
prodigious
labour
it
took
up
any
one
may
imagine
at
the
same
time
i
contrived
to
increase
my
little
flock
of
tame
goats
as
much
as
i
could
and
for
this
purpose
i
made
friday
and
the
spaniard
go
out
one
day
and
myself
with
friday
the
next
day
for
we
took
our
turns
and
by
this
means
we
got
about
twenty
young
kids
to
breed
up
with
the
rest
for
whenever
we
shot
the
dam
we
saved
the
kids
and
added
them
to
our
flock
but
above
all
the
season
for
curing
the
grapes
coming
on
i
caused
such
a
prodigious
quantity
to
be
hung
up
in
the
sun
that
i
believe
had
we
been
at
alicant
where
the
raisins
of
the
sun
are
cured
we
could
have
filled
sixty
or
eighty
barrels
and
these
with
our
bread
formed
a
great
part
of
our
food
very
good
living
too
i
assure
you
for
they
are
exceedingly
nourishing
it
was
now
harvest
and
our
crop
in
good
order
it
was
not
the
most
plentiful
increase
i
had
seen
in
the
island
but
however
it
was
enough
to
answer
our
end
for
from
twenty
two
bushels
of
barley
we
brought
in
and
thrashed
out
above
two
hundred
and
twenty
bushels
and
the
like
in
proportion
of
the
rice
which
was
store
enough
for
our
food
to
the
next
harvest
though
all
the
sixteen
spaniards
had
been
on
shore
with
me
or
if
we
had
been
ready
for
a
voyage
it
would
very
plentifully
have
victualled
our
ship
to
have
carried
us
to
any
part
of
the
world
that
is
to
say
any
part
of
america
when
we
had
thus
housed
and
secured
our
magazine
of
corn
we
fell
to
work
to
make
more
wicker
ware
viz
great
baskets
in
which
we
kept
it
and
the
spaniard
was
very
handy
and
dexterous
at
this
part
and
often
blamed
me
that
i
did
not
make
some
things
for
defence
of
this
kind
of
work
but
i
saw
no
need
of
it
and
now
having
a
full
supply
of
food
for
all
the
guests
i
expected
i
gave
the
spaniard
leave
to
go
over
to
the
main
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
those
he
had
left
behind
him
there
i
gave
him
a
strict
charge
not
to
bring
any
man
who
would
not
first
swear
in
the
presence
of
himself
and
the
old
savage
that
he
would
in
no
way
injure
fight
with
or
attack
the
person
he
should
find
in
the
island
who
was
so
kind
as
to
send
for
them
in
order
to
their
deliverance
but
that
they
would
stand
by
him
and
defend
him
against
all
such
attempts
and
wherever
they
went
would
be
entirely
under
and
subjected
to
his
command
and
that
this
should
be
put
in
writing
and
signed
in
their
hands
how
they
were
to
have
done
this
when
i
knew
they
had
neither
pen
nor
ink
was
a
question
which
we
never
asked
under
these
instructions
the
spaniard
and
the
old
savage
the
father
of
friday
went
away
in
one
of
the
canoes
which
they
might
be
said
to
have
come
in
or
rather
were
brought
in
when
they
came
as
prisoners
to
be
devoured
by
the
savages
i
gave
each
of
them
a
musket
with
a
firelock
on
it
and
about
eight
charges
of
powder
and
ball
charging
them
to
be
very
good
husbands
of
both
and
not
to
use
either
of
them
but
upon
urgent
occasions
this
was
a
cheerful
work
being
the
first
measures
used
by
me
in
view
of
my
deliverance
for
now
twenty
seven
years
and
some
days
i
gave
them
provisions
of
bread
and
of
dried
grapes
sufficient
for
themselves
for
many
days
and
sufficient
for
all
the
spaniards
for
about
eight
days
time
and
wishing
them
a
good
voyage
i
saw
them
go
agreeing
with
them
about
a
signal
they
should
hang
out
at
their
return
by
which
i
should
know
them
again
when
they
came
back
at
a
distance
before
they
came
on
shore
they
went
away
with
a
fair
gale
on
the
day
that
the
moon
was
at
full
by
my
account
in
the
month
of
october
but
as
for
an
exact
reckoning
of
days
after
i
had
once
lost
it
i
could
never
recover
it
again
nor
had
i
kept
even
the
number
of
years
so
punctually
as
to
be
sure
i
was
right
though
as
it
proved
when
i
afterwards
examined
my
account
i
found
i
had
kept
a
true
reckoning
of
years
it
was
no
less
than
eight
days
i
had
waited
for
them
when
a
strange
and
unforeseen
accident
intervened
of
which
the
like
has
not
perhaps
been
heard
of
in
history
i
was
fast
asleep
in
my
hutch
one
morning
when
my
man
friday
came
running
in
to
me
and
called
aloud
master
master
they
are
come
they
are
come
i
jumped
up
and
regardless
of
danger
i
went
as
soon
as
i
could
get
my
clothes
on
through
my
little
grove
which
by
the
way
was
by
this
time
grown
to
be
a
very
thick
wood
i
say
regardless
of
danger
i
went
without
my
arms
which
was
not
my
custom
to
do
but
i
was
surprised
when
turning
my
eyes
to
the
sea
i
presently
saw
a
boat
at
about
a
league
and
a
half
distance
standing
in
for
the
shore
with
a
shoulder
of
mutton
sail
as
they
call
it
and
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fair
to
bring
them
in
also
i
observed
presently
that
they
did
not
come
from
that
side
which
the
shore
lay
on
but
from
the
southernmost
end
of
the
island
upon
this
i
called
friday
in
and
bade
him
lie
close
for
these
were
not
the
people
we
looked
for
and
that
we
might
not
know
yet
whether
they
were
friends
or
enemies
in
the
next
place
i
went
in
to
fetch
my
perspective
glass
to
see
what
i
could
make
of
them
and
having
taken
the
ladder
out
i
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
as
i
used
to
do
when
i
was
apprehensive
of
anything
and
to
take
my
view
the
plainer
without
being
discovered
i
had
scarce
set
my
foot
upon
the
hill
when
my
eye
plainly
discovered
a
ship
lying
at
anchor
at
about
two
leagues
and
a
half
distance
from
me
sse
but
not
above
a
league
and
a
half
from
the
shore
by
my
observation
it
appeared
plainly
to
be
an
english
ship
and
the
boat
appeared
to
be
an
english
long
boat
i
cannot
express
the
confusion
i
was
in
though
the
joy
of
seeing
a
ship
and
one
that
i
had
reason
to
believe
was
manned
by
my
own
countrymen
and
consequently
friends
was
such
as
i
cannot
describe
but
yet
i
had
some
secret
doubts
hung
about
me
i
cannot
tell
from
whence
they
came
bidding
me
keep
upon
my
guard
in
the
first
place
it
occurred
to
me
to
consider
what
business
an
english
ship
could
have
in
that
part
of
the
world
since
it
was
not
the
way
to
or
from
any
part
of
the
world
where
the
english
had
any
traffic
and
i
knew
there
had
been
no
storms
to
drive
them
in
there
in
distress
and
that
if
they
were
really
english
it
was
most
probable
that
they
were
here
upon
no
good
design
and
that
i
had
better
continue
as
i
was
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
thieves
and
murderers
let
no
man
despise
the
secret
hints
and
notices
of
danger
which
sometimes
are
given
him
when
he
may
think
there
is
no
possibility
of
its
being
real
that
such
hints
and
notices
are
given
us
i
believe
few
that
have
made
any
observation
of
things
can
deny
that
they
are
certain
discoveries
of
an
invisible
world
and
a
converse
of
spirits
we
cannot
doubt
and
if
the
tendency
of
them
seems
to
be
to
warn
us
of
danger
why
should
we
not
suppose
they
are
from
some
friendly
agent
whether
supreme
or
inferior
and
subordinate
is
not
the
question
and
that
they
are
given
for
our
good
the
present
question
abundantly
confirms
me
in
the
justice
of
this
reasoning
for
had
i
not
been
made
cautious
by
this
secret
admonition
come
it
from
whence
it
will
i
had
been
done
inevitably
and
in
a
far
worse
condition
than
before
as
you
will
see
presently
i
had
not
kept
myself
long
in
this
posture
till
i
saw
the
boat
draw
near
the
shore
as
if
they
looked
for
a
creek
to
thrust
in
at
for
the
convenience
of
landing
however
as
they
did
not
come
quite
far
enough
they
did
not
see
the
little
inlet
where
i
formerly
landed
my
rafts
but
ran
their
boat
on
shore
upon
the
beach
at
about
half
a
mile
from
me
which
was
very
happy
for
me
for
otherwise
they
would
have
landed
just
at
my
door
as
i
may
say
and
would
soon
have
beaten
me
out
of
my
castle
and
perhaps
have
plundered
me
of
all
i
had
when
they
were
on
shore
i
was
fully
satisfied
they
were
englishmen
at
least
most
of
them
one
or
two
i
thought
were
dutch
but
it
did
not
prove
so
there
were
in
all
eleven
men
whereof
three
of
them
i
found
were
unarmed
and
as
i
thought
bound
and
when
the
first
four
or
five
of
them
were
jumped
on
shore
they
took
those
three
out
of
the
boat
as
prisoners
one
of
the
three
i
could
perceive
using
the
most
passionate
gestures
of
entreaty
affliction
and
despair
even
to
a
kind
of
extravagance
the
other
two
i
could
perceive
lifted
up
their
hands
sometimes
and
appeared
concerned
indeed
but
not
to
such
a
degree
as
the
first
i
was
perfectly
confounded
at
the
sight
and
knew
not
what
the
meaning
of
it
should
be
friday
called
out
to
me
in
english
as
well
as
he
could
o
master
you
see
english
mans
eat
prisoner
as
well
as
savage
mans
why
friday
says
i
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
eat
them
then
yes
says
friday
they
will
eat
them
no
no
says
i
friday
i
am
afraid
they
will
murder
them
indeed
but
you
may
be
sure
they
will
not
eat
them
all
this
while
i
had
no
thought
of
what
the
matter
really
was
but
stood
trembling
with
the
horror
of
the
sight
expecting
every
moment
when
the
three
prisoners
should
be
killed
nay
once
i
saw
one
of
the
villains
lift
up
his
arm
with
a
great
cutlass
as
the
seamen
call
it
or
sword
to
strike
one
of
the
poor
men
and
i
expected
to
see
him
fall
every
moment
at
which
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seemed
to
run
chill
in
my
veins
i
wished
heartily
now
for
the
spaniard
and
the
savage
that
had
gone
with
him
or
that
i
had
any
way
to
have
come
undiscovered
within
shot
of
them
that
i
might
have
secured
the
three
men
for
i
saw
no
firearms
they
had
among
them
but
it
fell
out
to
my
mind
another
way
after
i
had
observed
the
outrageous
usage
of
the
three
men
by
the
insolent
seamen
i
observed
the
fellows
run
scattering
about
the
island
as
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
country
i
observed
that
the
three
other
men
had
liberty
to
go
also
where
they
pleased
but
they
sat
down
all
three
upon
the
ground
very
pensive
and
looked
like
men
in
despair
this
put
me
in
mind
of
the
first
time
when
i
came
on
shore
and
began
to
look
about
me
how
i
gave
myself
over
for
lost
how
wildly
i
looked
round
me
what
dreadful
apprehensions
i
had
and
how
i
lodged
in
the
tree
all
night
for
fear
of
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
as
i
knew
nothing
that
night
of
the
supply
i
was
to
receive
by
the
providential
driving
of
the
ship
nearer
the
land
by
the
storms
and
tide
by
which
i
have
since
been
so
long
nourished
and
supported
so
these
three
poor
desolate
men
knew
nothing
how
certain
of
deliverance
and
supply
they
were
how
near
it
was
to
them
and
how
effectually
and
really
they
were
in
a
condition
of
safety
at
the
same
time
that
they
thought
themselves
lost
and
their
case
desperate
so
little
do
we
see
before
us
in
the
world
and
so
much
reason
have
we
to
depend
cheerfully
upon
the
great
maker
of
the
world
that
he
does
not
leave
his
creatures
so
absolutely
destitute
but
that
in
the
worst
circumstances
they
have
always
something
to
be
thankful
for
and
sometimes
are
nearer
deliverance
than
they
imagine
nay
are
even
brought
to
their
deliverance
by
the
means
by
which
they
seem
to
be
brought
to
their
destruction
it
was
just
at
high
water
when
these
people
came
on
shore
and
while
they
rambled
about
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
they
were
in
they
had
carelessly
stayed
till
the
tide
was
spent
and
the
water
was
ebbed
considerably
away
leaving
their
boat
aground
they
had
left
two
men
in
the
boat
who
as
i
found
afterwards
having
drunk
a
little
too
much
brandy
fell
asleep
however
one
of
them
waking
a
little
sooner
than
the
other
and
finding
the
boat
too
fast
aground
for
him
to
stir
it
hallooed
out
for
the
rest
who
were
straggling
about
upon
which
they
all
soon
came
to
the
boat
but
it
was
past
all
their
strength
to
launch
her
the
boat
being
very
heavy
and
the
shore
on
that
side
being
a
soft
oozy
sand
almost
like
a
quicksand
in
this
condition
like
true
seamen
who
are
perhaps
the
least
of
all
mankind
given
to
forethought
they
gave
it
over
and
away
they
strolled
about
the
country
again
and
i
heard
one
of
them
say
aloud
to
another
calling
them
off
from
the
boat
why
let
her
alone
jack
can
t
you
she
ll
float
next
tide
by
which
i
was
fully
confirmed
in
the
main
inquiry
of
what
countrymen
they
were
all
this
while
i
kept
myself
very
close
not
once
daring
to
stir
out
of
my
castle
any
farther
than
to
my
place
of
observation
near
the
top
of
the
hill
and
very
glad
i
was
to
think
how
well
it
was
fortified
i
knew
it
was
no
less
than
ten
hours
before
the
boat
could
float
again
and
by
that
time
it
would
be
dark
and
i
might
be
at
more
liberty
to
see
their
motions
and
to
hear
their
discourse
if
they
had
any
in
the
meantime
i
fitted
myself
up
for
a
battle
as
before
though
with
more
caution
knowing
i
had
to
do
with
another
kind
of
enemy
than
i
had
at
first
i
ordered
friday
also
whom
i
had
made
an
excellent
marksman
with
his
gun
to
load
himself
with
arms
i
took
myself
two
fowling
pieces
and
i
gave
him
three
muskets
my
figure
indeed
was
very
fierce
i
had
my
formidable
goat
skin
coat
on
with
the
great
cap
i
have
mentioned
a
naked
sword
by
my
side
two
pistols
in
my
belt
and
a
gun
upon
each
shoulder
it
was
my
design
as
i
said
above
not
to
have
made
any
attempt
till
it
was
dark
but
about
two
o
clock
being
the
heat
of
the
day
i
found
that
they
were
all
gone
straggling
into
the
woods
and
as
i
thought
laid
down
to
sleep
the
three
poor
distressed
men
too
anxious
for
their
condition
to
get
any
sleep
had
however
sat
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
great
tree
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
me
and
as
i
thought
out
of
sight
of
any
of
the
rest
upon
this
i
resolved
to
discover
myself
to
them
and
learn
something
of
their
condition
immediately
i
marched
as
above
my
man
friday
at
a
good
distance
behind
me
as
formidable
for
his
arms
as
i
but
not
making
quite
so
staring
a
spectre
like
figure
as
i
did
i
came
as
near
them
undiscovered
as
i
could
and
then
before
any
of
them
saw
me
i
called
aloud
to
them
in
spanish
what
are
ye
gentlemen
they
started
up
at
the
noise
but
were
ten
times
more
confounded
when
they
saw
me
and
the
uncouth
figure
that
i
made
they
made
no
answer
at
all
but
i
thought
i
perceived
them
just
going
to
fly
from
me
when
i
spoke
to
them
in
english
gentlemen
said
i
do
not
be
surprised
at
me
perhaps
you
may
have
a
friend
near
when
you
did
not
expect
it
he
must
be
sent
directly
from
heaven
then
said
one
of
them
very
gravely
to
me
and
pulling
off
his
hat
at
the
same
time
to
me
for
our
condition
is
past
the
help
of
man
all
help
is
from
heaven
sir
said
i
but
can
you
put
a
stranger
in
the
way
to
help
you
for
you
seem
to
be
in
some
great
distress
i
saw
you
when
you
landed
and
when
you
seemed
to
make
application
to
the
brutes
that
came
with
you
i
saw
one
of
them
lift
up
his
sword
to
kill
you
the
poor
man
with
tears
running
down
his
face
and
trembling
looking
like
one
astonished
returned
am
i
talking
to
god
or
man
is
it
a
real
man
or
an
angel
be
in
no
fear
about
that
sir
said
i
if
god
had
sent
an
angel
to
relieve
you
he
would
have
come
better
clothed
and
armed
after
another
manner
than
you
see
me
pray
lay
aside
your
fears
i
am
a
man
an
englishman
and
disposed
to
assist
you
you
see
i
have
one
servant
only
we
have
arms
and
ammunition
tell
us
freely
can
we
serve
you
what
is
your
case
our
case
sir
said
he
is
too
long
to
tell
you
while
our
murderers
are
so
near
us
but
in
short
sir
i
was
commander
of
that
ship
my
men
have
mutinied
against
me
they
have
been
hardly
prevailed
on
not
to
murder
me
and
at
last
have
set
me
on
shore
in
this
desolate
place
with
these
two
men
with
me
one
my
mate
the
other
a
passenger
where
we
expected
to
perish
believing
the
place
to
be
uninhabited
and
know
not
yet
what
to
think
of
it
where
are
these
brutes
your
enemies
said
i
do
you
know
where
they
are
gone
there
they
lie
sir
said
he
pointing
to
a
thicket
of
trees
my
heart
trembles
for
fear
they
have
seen
us
and
heard
you
speak
if
they
have
they
will
certainly
murder
us
all
have
they
any
firearms
said
i
he
answered
they
had
only
two
pieces
one
of
which
they
left
in
the
boat
well
then
said
i
leave
the
rest
to
me
i
see
they
are
all
asleep
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
kill
them
all
but
shall
we
rather
take
them
prisoners
he
told
me
there
were
two
desperate
villains
among
them
that
it
was
scarce
safe
to
show
any
mercy
to
but
if
they
were
secured
he
believed
all
the
rest
would
return
to
their
duty
i
asked
him
which
they
were
he
told
me
he
could
not
at
that
distance
distinguish
them
but
he
would
obey
my
orders
in
anything
i
would
direct
well
says
i
let
us
retreat
out
of
their
view
or
hearing
lest
they
awake
and
we
will
resolve
further
so
they
willingly
went
back
with
me
till
the
woods
covered
us
from
them
look
you
sir
said
i
if
i
venture
upon
your
deliverance
are
you
willing
to
make
two
conditions
with
me
he
anticipated
my
proposals
by
telling
me
that
both
he
and
the
ship
if
recovered
should
be
wholly
directed
and
commanded
by
me
in
everything
and
if
the
ship
was
not
recovered
he
would
live
and
die
with
me
in
what
part
of
the
world
soever
i
would
send
him
and
the
two
other
men
said
the
same
well
says
i
my
conditions
are
but
two
first
that
while
you
stay
in
this
island
with
me
you
will
not
pretend
to
any
authority
here
and
if
i
put
arms
in
your
hands
you
will
upon
all
occasions
give
them
up
to
me
and
do
no
prejudice
to
me
or
mine
upon
this
island
and
in
the
meantime
be
governed
by
my
orders
secondly
that
if
the
ship
is
or
may
be
recovered
you
will
carry
me
and
my
man
to
england
passage
free
he
gave
me
all
the
assurances
that
the
invention
or
faith
of
man
could
devise
that
he
would
comply
with
these
most
reasonable
demands
and
besides
would
owe
his
life
to
me
and
acknowledge
it
upon
all
occasions
as
long
as
he
lived
well
then
said
i
here
are
three
muskets
for
you
with
powder
and
ball
tell
me
next
what
you
think
is
proper
to
be
done
he
showed
all
the
testimonies
of
his
gratitude
that
he
was
able
but
offered
to
be
wholly
guided
by
me
i
told
him
i
thought
it
was
very
hard
venturing
anything
but
the
best
method
i
could
think
of
was
to
fire
on
them
at
once
as
they
lay
and
if
any
were
not
killed
at
the
first
volley
and
offered
to
submit
we
might
save
them
and
so
put
it
wholly
upon
god
s
providence
to
direct
the
shot
he
said
very
modestly
that
he
was
loath
to
kill
them
if
he
could
help
it
but
that
those
two
were
incorrigible
villains
and
had
been
the
authors
of
all
the
mutiny
in
the
ship
and
if
they
escaped
we
should
be
undone
still
for
they
would
go
on
board
and
bring
the
whole
ship
s
company
and
destroy
us
all
well
then
says
i
necessity
legitimates
my
advice
for
it
is
the
only
way
to
save
our
lives
however
seeing
him
still
cautious
of
shedding
blood
i
told
him
they
should
go
themselves
and
manage
as
they
found
convenient
in
the
middle
of
this
discourse
we
heard
some
of
them
awake
and
soon
after
we
saw
two
of
them
on
their
feet
i
asked
him
if
either
of
them
were
the
heads
of
the
mutiny
he
said
no
well
then
said
i
you
may
let
them
escape
and
providence
seems
to
have
awakened
them
on
purpose
to
save
themselves
now
says
i
if
the
rest
escape
you
it
is
your
fault
animated
with
this
he
took
the
musket
i
had
given
him
in
his
hand
and
a
pistol
in
his
belt
and
his
two
comrades
with
him
with
each
a
piece
in
his
hand
the
two
men
who
were
with
him
going
first
made
some
noise
at
which
one
of
the
seamen
who
was
awake
turned
about
and
seeing
them
coming
cried
out
to
the
rest
but
was
too
late
then
for
the
moment
he
cried
out
they
fired
i
mean
the
two
men
the
captain
wisely
reserving
his
own
piece
they
had
so
well
aimed
their
shot
at
the
men
they
knew
that
one
of
them
was
killed
on
the
spot
and
the
other
very
much
wounded
but
not
being
dead
he
started
up
on
his
feet
and
called
eagerly
for
help
to
the
other
but
the
captain
stepping
to
him
told
him
it
was
too
late
to
cry
for
help
he
should
call
upon
god
to
forgive
his
villainy
and
with
that
word
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
his
musket
so
that
he
never
spoke
more
there
were
three
more
in
the
company
and
one
of
them
was
slightly
wounded
by
this
time
i
was
come
and
when
they
saw
their
danger
and
that
it
was
in
vain
to
resist
they
begged
for
mercy
the
captain
told
them
he
would
spare
their
lives
if
they
would
give
him
an
assurance
of
their
abhorrence
of
the
treachery
they
had
been
guilty
of
and
would
swear
to
be
faithful
to
him
in
recovering
the
ship
and
afterwards
in
carrying
her
back
to
jamaica
from
whence
they
came
they
gave
him
all
the
protestations
of
their
sincerity
that
could
be
desired
and
he
was
willing
to
believe
them
and
spare
their
lives
which
i
was
not
against
only
that
i
obliged
him
to
keep
them
bound
hand
and
foot
while
they
were
on
the
island
while
this
was
doing
i
sent
friday
with
the
captain
s
mate
to
the
boat
with
orders
to
secure
her
and
bring
away
the
oars
and
sails
which
they
did
and
by
and
by
three
straggling
men
that
were
happily
for
them
parted
from
the
rest
came
back
upon
hearing
the
guns
fired
and
seeing
the
captain
who
was
before
their
prisoner
now
their
conqueror
they
submitted
to
be
bound
also
and
so
our
victory
was
complete
it
now
remained
that
the
captain
and
i
should
inquire
into
one
another
s
circumstances
i
began
first
and
told
him
my
whole
history
which
he
heard
with
an
attention
even
to
amazement
and
particularly
at
the
wonderful
manner
of
my
being
furnished
with
provisions
and
ammunition
and
indeed
as
my
story
is
a
whole
collection
of
wonders
it
affected
him
deeply
but
when
he
reflected
from
thence
upon
himself
and
how
i
seemed
to
have
been
preserved
there
on
purpose
to
save
his
life
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
and
he
could
not
speak
a
word
more
after
this
communication
was
at
an
end
i
carried
him
and
his
two
men
into
my
apartment
leading
them
in
just
where
i
came
out
viz
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
i
refreshed
them
with
such
provisions
as
i
had
and
showed
them
all
the
contrivances
i
had
made
during
my
long
long
inhabiting
that
place
all
i
showed
them
all
i
said
to
them
was
perfectly
amazing
but
above
all
the
captain
admired
my
fortification
and
how
perfectly
i
had
concealed
my
retreat
with
a
grove
of
trees
which
having
been
now
planted
nearly
twenty
years
and
the
trees
growing
much
faster
than
in
england
was
become
a
little
wood
so
thick
that
it
was
impassable
in
any
part
of
it
but
at
that
one
side
where
i
had
reserved
my
little
winding
passage
into
it
i
told
him
this
was
my
castle
and
my
residence
but
that
i
had
a
seat
in
the
country
as
most
princes
have
whither
i
could
retreat
upon
occasion
and
i
would
show
him
that
too
another
time
but
at
present
our
business
was
to
consider
how
to
recover
the
ship
he
agreed
with
me
as
to
that
but
told
me
he
was
perfectly
at
a
loss
what
measures
to
take
for
that
there
were
still
six
and
twenty
hands
on
board
who
having
entered
into
a
cursed
conspiracy
by
which
they
had
all
forfeited
their
lives
to
the
law
would
be
hardened
in
it
now
by
desperation
and
would
carry
it
on
knowing
that
if
they
were
subdued
they
would
be
brought
to
the
gallows
as
soon
as
they
came
to
england
or
to
any
of
the
english
colonies
and
that
therefore
there
would
be
no
attacking
them
with
so
small
a
number
as
we
were
i
mused
for
some
time
on
what
he
had
said
and
found
it
was
a
very
rational
conclusion
and
that
therefore
something
was
to
be
resolved
on
speedily
as
well
to
draw
the
men
on
board
into
some
snare
for
their
surprise
as
to
prevent
their
landing
upon
us
and
destroying
us
upon
this
it
presently
occurred
to
me
that
in
a
little
while
the
ship
s
crew
wondering
what
was
become
of
their
comrades
and
of
the
boat
would
certainly
come
on
shore
in
their
other
boat
to
look
for
them
and
that
then
perhaps
they
might
come
armed
and
be
too
strong
for
us
this
he
allowed
to
be
rational
upon
this
i
told
him
the
first
thing
we
had
to
do
was
to
stave
the
boat
which
lay
upon
the
beach
so
that
they
might
not
carry
her
of
and
taking
everything
out
of
her
leave
her
so
far
useless
as
not
to
be
fit
to
swim
accordingly
we
went
on
board
took
the
arms
which
were
left
on
board
out
of
her
and
whatever
else
we
found
there
which
was
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
another
of
rum
a
few
biscuit
cakes
a
horn
of
powder
and
a
great
lump
of
sugar
in
a
piece
of
canvas
the
sugar
was
five
or
six
pounds
all
which
was
very
welcome
to
me
especially
the
brandy
and
sugar
of
which
i
had
had
none
left
for
many
years
when
we
had
carried
all
these
things
on
shore
the
oars
mast
sail
and
rudder
of
the
boat
were
carried
away
before
we
knocked
a
great
hole
in
her
bottom
that
if
they
had
come
strong
enough
to
master
us
yet
they
could
not
carry
off
the
boat
indeed
it
was
not
much
in
my
thoughts
that
we
could
be
able
to
recover
the
ship
but
my
view
was
that
if
they
went
away
without
the
boat
i
did
not
much
question
to
make
her
again
fit
to
carry
as
to
the
leeward
islands
and
call
upon
our
friends
the
spaniards
in
my
way
for
i
had
them
still
in
my
thoughts
chapter
xviii
the
ship
recovered
while
we
were
thus
preparing
our
designs
and
had
first
by
main
strength
heaved
the
boat
upon
the
beach
so
high
that
the
tide
would
not
float
her
off
at
high
water
mark
and
besides
had
broke
a
hole
in
her
bottom
too
big
to
be
quickly
stopped
and
were
set
down
musing
what
we
should
do
we
heard
the
ship
fire
a
gun
and
make
a
waft
with
her
ensign
as
a
signal
for
the
boat
to
come
on
board
but
no
boat
stirred
and
they
fired
several
times
making
other
signals
for
the
boat
at
last
when
all
their
signals
and
firing
proved
fruitless
and
they
found
the
boat
did
not
stir
we
saw
them
by
the
help
of
my
glasses
hoist
another
boat
out
and
row
towards
the
shore
and
we
found
as
they
approached
that
there
were
no
less
than
ten
men
in
her
and
that
they
had
firearms
with
them
as
the
ship
lay
almost
two
leagues
from
the
shore
we
had
a
full
view
of
them
as
they
came
and
a
plain
sight
even
of
their
faces
because
the
tide
having
set
them
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
other
boat
they
rowed
up
under
shore
to
come
to
the
same
place
where
the
other
had
landed
and
where
the
boat
lay
by
this
means
i
say
we
had
a
full
view
of
them
and
the
captain
knew
the
persons
and
characters
of
all
the
men
in
the
boat
of
whom
he
said
there
were
three
very
honest
fellows
who
he
was
sure
were
led
into
this
conspiracy
by
the
rest
being
over
powered
and
frightened
but
that
as
for
the
boatswain
who
it
seems
was
the
chief
officer
among
them
and
all
the
rest
they
were
as
outrageous
as
any
of
the
ship
s
crew
and
were
no
doubt
made
desperate
in
their
new
enterprise
and
terribly
apprehensive
he
was
that
they
would
be
too
powerful
for
us
i
smiled
at
him
and
told
him
that
men
in
our
circumstances
were
past
the
operation
of
fear
that
seeing
almost
every
condition
that
could
be
was
better
than
that
which
we
were
supposed
to
be
in
we
ought
to
expect
that
the
consequence
whether
death
or
life
would
be
sure
to
be
a
deliverance
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
circumstances
of
my
life
and
whether
a
deliverance
were
not
worth
venturing
for
and
where
sir
said
i
is
your
belief
of
my
being
preserved
here
on
purpose
to
save
your
life
which
elevated
you
a
little
while
ago
for
my
part
said
i
there
seems
to
be
but
one
thing
amiss
in
all
the
prospect
of
it
what
is
that
say
he
why
said
i
it
is
that
as
you
say
there
are
three
or
four
honest
fellows
among
them
which
should
be
spared
had
they
been
all
of
the
wicked
part
of
the
crew
i
should
have
thought
god
s
providence
had
singled
them
out
to
deliver
them
into
your
hands
for
depend
upon
it
every
man
that
comes
ashore
is
our
own
and
shall
die
or
live
as
they
behave
to
us
as
i
spoke
this
with
a
raised
voice
and
cheerful
countenance
i
found
it
greatly
encouraged
him
so
we
set
vigorously
to
our
business
we
had
upon
the
first
appearance
of
the
boat
s
coming
from
the
ship
considered
of
separating
our
prisoners
and
we
had
indeed
secured
them
effectually
two
of
them
of
whom
the
captain
was
less
assured
than
ordinary
i
sent
with
friday
and
one
of
the
three
delivered
men
to
my
cave
where
they
were
remote
enough
and
out
of
danger
of
being
heard
or
discovered
or
of
finding
their
way
out
of
the
woods
if
they
could
have
delivered
themselves
here
they
left
them
bound
but
gave
them
provisions
and
promised
them
if
they
continued
there
quietly
to
give
them
their
liberty
in
a
day
or
two
but
that
if
they
attempted
their
escape
they
should
be
put
to
death
without
mercy
they
promised
faithfully
to
bear
their
confinement
with
patience
and
were
very
thankful
that
they
had
such
good
usage
as
to
have
provisions
and
light
left
them
for
friday
gave
them
candles
such
as
we
made
ourselves
for
their
comfort
and
they
did
not
know
but
that
he
stood
sentinel
over
them
at
the
entrance
the
other
prisoners
had
better
usage
two
of
them
were
kept
pinioned
indeed
because
the
captain
was
not
able
to
trust
them
but
the
other
two
were
taken
into
my
service
upon
the
captain
s
recommendation
and
upon
their
solemnly
engaging
to
live
and
die
with
us
so
with
them
and
the
three
honest
men
we
were
seven
men
well
armed
and
i
made
no
doubt
we
should
be
able
to
deal
well
enough
with
the
ten
that
were
coming
considering
that
the
captain
had
said
there
were
three
or
four
honest
men
among
them
also
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
place
where
their
other
boat
lay
they
ran
their
boat
into
the
beach
and
came
all
on
shore
hauling
the
boat
up
after
them
which
i
was
glad
to
see
for
i
was
afraid
they
would
rather
have
left
the
boat
at
an
anchor
some
distance
from
the
shore
with
some
hands
in
her
to
guard
her
and
so
we
should
not
be
able
to
seize
the
boat
being
on
shore
the
first
thing
they
did
they
ran
all
to
their
other
boat
and
it
was
easy
to
see
they
were
under
a
great
surprise
to
find
her
stripped
as
above
of
all
that
was
in
her
and
a
great
hole
in
her
bottom
after
they
had
mused
a
while
upon
this
they
set
up
two
or
three
great
shouts
hallooing
with
all
their
might
to
try
if
they
could
make
their
companions
hear
but
all
was
to
no
purpose
then
they
came
all
close
in
a
ring
and
fired
a
volley
of
their
small
arms
which
indeed
we
heard
and
the
echoes
made
the
woods
ring
but
it
was
all
one
those
in
the
cave
we
were
sure
could
not
hear
and
those
in
our
keeping
though
they
heard
it
well
enough
yet
durst
give
no
answer
to
them
they
were
so
astonished
at
the
surprise
of
this
that
as
they
told
us
afterwards
they
resolved
to
go
all
on
board
again
to
their
ship
and
let
them
know
that
the
men
were
all
murdered
and
the
long
boat
staved
accordingly
they
immediately
launched
their
boat
again
and
got
all
of
them
on
board
the
captain
was
terribly
amazed
and
even
confounded
at
this
believing
they
would
go
on
board
the
ship
again
and
set
sail
giving
their
comrades
over
for
lost
and
so
he
should
still
lose
the
ship
which
he
was
in
hopes
we
should
have
recovered
but
he
was
quickly
as
much
frightened
the
other
way
they
had
not
been
long
put
off
with
the
boat
when
we
perceived
them
all
coming
on
shore
again
but
with
this
new
measure
in
their
conduct
which
it
seems
they
consulted
together
upon
viz
to
leave
three
men
in
the
boat
and
the
rest
to
go
on
shore
and
go
up
into
the
country
to
look
for
their
fellows
this
was
a
great
disappointment
to
us
for
now
we
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
as
our
seizing
those
seven
men
on
shore
would
be
no
advantage
to
us
if
we
let
the
boat
escape
because
they
would
row
away
to
the
ship
and
then
the
rest
of
them
would
be
sure
to
weigh
and
set
sail
and
so
our
recovering
the
ship
would
be
lost
however
we
had
no
remedy
but
to
wait
and
see
what
the
issue
of
things
might
present
the
seven
men
came
on
shore
and
the
three
who
remained
in
the
boat
put
her
off
to
a
good
distance
from
the
shore
and
came
to
an
anchor
to
wait
for
them
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
come
at
them
in
the
boat
those
that
came
on
shore
kept
close
together
marching
towards
the
top
of
the
little
hill
under
which
my
habitation
lay
and
we
could
see
them
plainly
though
they
could
not
perceive
us
we
should
have
been
very
glad
if
they
would
have
come
nearer
us
so
that
we
might
have
fired
at
them
or
that
they
would
have
gone
farther
off
that
we
might
come
abroad
but
when
they
were
come
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
they
could
see
a
great
way
into
the
valleys
and
woods
which
lay
towards
the
north
east
part
and
where
the
island
lay
lowest
they
shouted
and
hallooed
till
they
were
weary
and
not
caring
it
seems
to
venture
far
from
the
shore
nor
far
from
one
another
they
sat
down
together
under
a
tree
to
consider
it
had
they
thought
fit
to
have
gone
to
sleep
there
as
the
other
part
of
them
had
done
they
had
done
the
job
for
us
but
they
were
too
full
of
apprehensions
of
danger
to
venture
to
go
to
sleep
though
they
could
not
tell
what
the
danger
was
they
had
to
fear
the
captain
made
a
very
just
proposal
to
me
upon
this
consultation
of
theirs
viz
that
perhaps
they
would
all
fire
a
volley
again
to
endeavour
to
make
their
fellows
hear
and
that
we
should
all
sally
upon
them
just
at
the
juncture
when
their
pieces
were
all
discharged
and
they
would
certainly
yield
and
we
should
have
them
without
bloodshed
i
liked
this
proposal
provided
it
was
done
while
we
were
near
enough
to
come
up
to
them
before
they
could
load
their
pieces
again
but
this
event
did
not
happen
and
we
lay
still
a
long
time
very
irresolute
what
course
to
take
at
length
i
told
them
there
would
be
nothing
done
in
my
opinion
till
night
and
then
if
they
did
not
return
to
the
boat
perhaps
we
might
find
a
way
to
get
between
them
and
the
shore
and
so
might
use
some
stratagem
with
them
in
the
boat
to
get
them
on
shore
we
waited
a
great
while
though
very
impatient
for
their
removing
and
were
very
uneasy
when
after
long
consultation
we
saw
them
all
start
up
and
march
down
towards
the
sea
it
seems
they
had
such
dreadful
apprehensions
of
the
danger
of
the
place
that
they
resolved
to
go
on
board
the
ship
again
give
their
companions
over
for
lost
and
so
go
on
with
their
intended
voyage
with
the
ship
as
soon
as
i
perceived
them
go
towards
the
shore
i
imagined
it
to
be
as
it
really
was
that
they
had
given
over
their
search
and
were
going
back
again
and
the
captain
as
soon
as
i
told
him
my
thoughts
was
ready
to
sink
at
the
apprehensions
of
it
but
i
presently
thought
of
a
stratagem
to
fetch
them
back
again
and
which
answered
my
end
to
a
tittle
i
ordered
friday
and
the
captain
s
mate
to
go
over
the
little
creek
westward
towards
the
place
where
the
savages
came
on
shore
when
friday
was
rescued
and
so
soon
as
they
came
to
a
little
rising
round
at
about
half
a
mile
distant
i
bid
them
halloo
out
as
loud
as
they
could
and
wait
till
they
found
the
seamen
heard
them
that
as
soon
as
ever
they
heard
the
seamen
answer
them
they
should
return
it
again
and
then
keeping
out
of
sight
take
a
round
always
answering
when
the
others
hallooed
to
draw
them
as
far
into
the
island
and
among
the
woods
as
possible
and
then
wheel
about
again
to
me
by
such
ways
as
i
directed
them
they
were
just
going
into
the
boat
when
friday
and
the
mate
hallooed
and
they
presently
heard
them
and
answering
ran
along
the
shore
westward
towards
the
voice
they
heard
when
they
were
stopped
by
the
creek
where
the
water
being
up
they
could
not
get
over
and
called
for
the
boat
to
come
up
and
set
them
over
as
indeed
i
expected
when
they
had
set
themselves
over
i
observed
that
the
boat
being
gone
a
good
way
into
the
creek
and
as
it
were
in
a
harbour
within
the
land
they
took
one
of
the
three
men
out
of
her
to
go
along
with
them
and
left
only
two
in
the
boat
having
fastened
her
to
the
stump
of
a
little
tree
on
the
shore
this
was
what
i
wished
for
and
immediately
leaving
friday
and
the
captain
s
mate
to
their
business
i
took
the
rest
with
me
and
crossing
the
creek
out
of
their
sight
we
surprised
the
two
men
before
they
were
aware
one
of
them
lying
on
the
shore
and
the
other
being
in
the
boat
the
fellow
on
shore
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
and
going
to
start
up
the
captain
who
was
foremost
ran
in
upon
him
and
knocked
him
down
and
then
called
out
to
him
in
the
boat
to
yield
or
he
was
a
dead
man
they
needed
very
few
arguments
to
persuade
a
single
man
to
yield
when
he
saw
five
men
upon
him
and
his
comrade
knocked
down
besides
this
was
it
seems
one
of
the
three
who
were
not
so
hearty
in
the
mutiny
as
the
rest
of
the
crew
and
therefore
was
easily
persuaded
not
only
to
yield
but
afterwards
to
join
very
sincerely
with
us
in
the
meantime
friday
and
the
captain
s
mate
so
well
managed
their
business
with
the
rest
that
they
drew
them
by
hallooing
and
answering
from
one
hill
to
another
and
from
one
wood
to
another
till
they
not
only
heartily
tired
them
but
left
them
where
they
were
very
sure
they
could
not
reach
back
to
the
boat
before
it
was
dark
and
indeed
they
were
heartily
tired
themselves
also
by
the
time
they
came
back
to
us
we
had
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
watch
for
them
in
the
dark
and
to
fall
upon
them
so
as
to
make
sure
work
with
them
it
was
several
hours
after
friday
came
back
to
me
before
they
came
back
to
their
boat
and
we
could
hear
the
foremost
of
them
long
before
they
came
quite
up
calling
to
those
behind
to
come
along
and
could
also
hear
them
answer
and
complain
how
lame
and
tired
they
were
and
not
able
to
come
any
faster
which
was
very
welcome
news
to
us
at
length
they
came
up
to
the
boat
but
it
is
impossible
to
express
their
confusion
when
they
found
the
boat
fast
aground
in
the
creek
the
tide
ebbed
out
and
their
two
men
gone
we
could
hear
them
call
one
to
another
in
a
most
lamentable
manner
telling
one
another
they
were
got
into
an
enchanted
island
that
either
there
were
inhabitants
in
it
and
they
should
all
be
murdered
or
else
there
were
devils
and
spirits
in
it
and
they
should
be
all
carried
away
and
devoured
they
hallooed
again
and
called
their
two
comrades
by
their
names
a
great
many
times
but
no
answer
after
some
time
we
could
see
them
by
the
little
light
there
was
run
about
wringing
their
hands
like
men
in
despair
and
sometimes
they
would
go
and
sit
down
in
the
boat
to
rest
themselves
then
come
ashore
again
and
walk
about
again
and
so
the
same
thing
over
again
my
men
would
fain
have
had
me
give
them
leave
to
fall
upon
them
at
once
in
the
dark
but
i
was
willing
to
take
them
at
some
advantage
so
as
to
spare
them
and
kill
as
few
of
them
as
i
could
and
especially
i
was
unwilling
to
hazard
the
killing
of
any
of
our
men
knowing
the
others
were
very
well
armed
i
resolved
to
wait
to
see
if
they
did
not
separate
and
therefore
to
make
sure
of
them
i
drew
my
ambuscade
nearer
and
ordered
friday
and
the
captain
to
creep
upon
their
hands
and
feet
as
close
to
the
ground
as
they
could
that
they
might
not
be
discovered
and
get
as
near
them
as
they
could
possibly
before
they
offered
to
fire
they
had
not
been
long
in
that
posture
when
the
boatswain
who
was
the
principal
ringleader
of
the
mutiny
and
had
now
shown
himself
the
most
dejected
and
dispirited
of
all
the
rest
came
walking
towards
them
with
two
more
of
the
crew
the
captain
was
so
eager
at
having
this
principal
rogue
so
much
in
his
power
that
he
could
hardly
have
patience
to
let
him
come
so
near
as
to
be
sure
of
him
for
they
only
heard
his
tongue
before
but
when
they
came
nearer
the
captain
and
friday
starting
up
on
their
feet
let
fly
at
them
the
boatswain
was
killed
upon
the
spot
the
next
man
was
shot
in
the
body
and
fell
just
by
him
though
he
did
not
die
till
an
hour
or
two
after
and
the
third
ran
for
it
at
the
noise
of
the
fire
i
immediately
advanced
with
my
whole
army
which
was
now
eight
men
viz
myself
generalissimo
friday
my
lieutenant
general
the
captain
and
his
two
men
and
the
three
prisoners
of
war
whom
we
had
trusted
with
arms
we
came
upon
them
indeed
in
the
dark
so
that
they
could
not
see
our
number
and
i
made
the
man
they
had
left
in
the
boat
who
was
now
one
of
us
to
call
them
by
name
to
try
if
i
could
bring
them
to
a
parley
and
so
perhaps
might
reduce
them
to
terms
which
fell
out
just
as
we
desired
for
indeed
it
was
easy
to
think
as
their
condition
then
was
they
would
be
very
willing
to
capitulate
so
he
calls
out
as
loud
as
he
could
to
one
of
them
tom
smith
tom
smith
tom
smith
answered
immediately
is
that
robinson
for
it
seems
he
knew
the
voice
the
other
answered
ay
ay
for
god
s
sake
tom
smith
throw
down
your
arms
and
yield
or
you
are
all
dead
men
this
moment
who
must
we
yield
to
where
are
they
says
smith
again
here
they
are
says
he
here
s
our
captain
and
fifty
men
with
him
have
been
hunting
you
these
two
hours
the
boatswain
is
killed
will
fry
is
wounded
and
i
am
a
prisoner
and
if
you
do
not
yield
you
are
all
lost
will
they
give
us
quarter
then
says
tom
smith
and
we
will
yield
i
ll
go
and
ask
if
you
promise
to
yield
said
robinson
so
he
asked
the
captain
and
the
captain
himself
then
calls
out
you
smith
you
know
my
voice
if
you
lay
down
your
arms
immediately
and
submit
you
shall
have
your
lives
all
but
will
atkins
upon
this
will
atkins
cried
out
for
god
s
sake
captain
give
me
quarter
what
have
i
done
they
have
all
been
as
bad
as
i
which
by
the
way
was
not
true
for
it
seems
this
will
atkins
was
the
first
man
that
laid
hold
of
the
captain
when
they
first
mutinied
and
used
him
barbarously
in
tying
his
hands
and
giving
him
injurious
language
however
the
captain
told
him
he
must
lay
down
his
arms
at
discretion
and
trust
to
the
governor
s
mercy
by
which
he
meant
me
for
they
all
called
me
governor
in
a
word
they
all
laid
down
their
arms
and
begged
their
lives
and
i
sent
the
man
that
had
parleyed
with
them
and
two
more
who
bound
them
all
and
then
my
great
army
of
fifty
men
which
with
those
three
were
in
all
but
eight
came
up
and
seized
upon
them
and
upon
their
boat
only
that
i
kept
myself
and
one
more
out
of
sight
for
reasons
of
state
our
next
work
was
to
repair
the
boat
and
think
of
seizing
the
ship
and
as
for
the
captain
now
he
had
leisure
to
parley
with
them
he
expostulated
with
them
upon
the
villainy
of
their
practices
with
him
and
upon
the
further
wickedness
of
their
design
and
how
certainly
it
must
bring
them
to
misery
and
distress
in
the
end
and
perhaps
to
the
gallows
they
all
appeared
very
penitent
and
begged
hard
for
their
lives
as
for
that
he
told
them
they
were
not
his
prisoners
but
the
commander
s
of
the
island
that
they
thought
they
had
set
him
on
shore
in
a
barren
uninhabited
island
but
it
had
pleased
god
so
to
direct
them
that
it
was
inhabited
and
that
the
governor
was
an
englishman
that
he
might
hang
them
all
there
if
he
pleased
but
as
he
had
given
them
all
quarter
he
supposed
he
would
send
them
to
england
to
be
dealt
with
there
as
justice
required
except
atkins
whom
he
was
commanded
by
the
governor
to
advise
to
prepare
for
death
for
that
he
would
be
hanged
in
the
morning
though
this
was
all
but
a
fiction
of
his
own
yet
it
had
its
desired
effect
atkins
fell
upon
his
knees
to
beg
the
captain
to
intercede
with
the
governor
for
his
life
and
all
the
rest
begged
of
him
for
god
s
sake
that
they
might
not
be
sent
to
england
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
the
time
of
our
deliverance
was
come
and
that
it
would
be
a
most
easy
thing
to
bring
these
fellows
in
to
be
hearty
in
getting
possession
of
the
ship
so
i
retired
in
the
dark
from
them
that
they
might
not
see
what
kind
of
a
governor
they
had
and
called
the
captain
to
me
when
i
called
at
a
good
distance
one
of
the
men
was
ordered
to
speak
again
and
say
to
the
captain
captain
the
commander
calls
for
you
and
presently
the
captain
replied
tell
his
excellency
i
am
just
coming
this
more
perfectly
amazed
them
and
they
all
believed
that
the
commander
was
just
by
with
his
fifty
men
upon
the
captain
coming
to
me
i
told
him
my
project
for
seizing
the
ship
which
he
liked
wonderfully
well
and
resolved
to
put
it
in
execution
the
next
morning
but
in
order
to
execute
it
with
more
art
and
to
be
secure
of
success
i
told
him
we
must
divide
the
prisoners
and
that
he
should
go
and
take
atkins
and
two
more
of
the
worst
of
them
and
send
them
pinioned
to
the
cave
where
the
others
lay
this
was
committed
to
friday
and
the
two
men
who
came
on
shore
with
the
captain
they
conveyed
them
to
the
cave
as
to
a
prison
and
it
was
indeed
a
dismal
place
especially
to
men
in
their
condition
the
others
i
ordered
to
my
bower
as
i
called
it
of
which
i
have
given
a
full
description
and
as
it
was
fenced
in
and
they
pinioned
the
place
was
secure
enough
considering
they
were
upon
their
behaviour
to
these
in
the
morning
i
sent
the
captain
who
was
to
enter
into
a
parley
with
them
in
a
word
to
try
them
and
tell
me
whether
he
thought
they
might
be
trusted
or
not
to
go
on
board
and
surprise
the
ship
he
talked
to
them
of
the
injury
done
him
of
the
condition
they
were
brought
to
and
that
though
the
governor
had
given
them
quarter
for
their
lives
as
to
the
present
action
yet
that
if
they
were
sent
to
england
they
would
all
be
hanged
in
chains
but
that
if
they
would
join
in
so
just
an
attempt
as
to
recover
the
ship
he
would
have
the
governor
s
engagement
for
their
pardon
any
one
may
guess
how
readily
such
a
proposal
would
be
accepted
by
men
in
their
condition
they
fell
down
on
their
knees
to
the
captain
and
promised
with
the
deepest
imprecations
that
they
would
be
faithful
to
him
to
the
last
drop
and
that
they
should
owe
their
lives
to
him
and
would
go
with
him
all
over
the
world
that
they
would
own
him
as
a
father
to
them
as
long
as
they
lived
well
says
the
captain
i
must
go
and
tell
the
governor
what
you
say
and
see
what
i
can
do
to
bring
him
to
consent
to
it
so
he
brought
me
an
account
of
the
temper
he
found
them
in
and
that
he
verily
believed
they
would
be
faithful
however
that
we
might
be
very
secure
i
told
him
he
should
go
back
again
and
choose
out
those
five
and
tell
them
that
they
might
see
he
did
not
want
men
that
he
would
take
out
those
five
to
be
his
assistants
and
that
the
governor
would
keep
the
other
two
and
the
three
that
were
sent
prisoners
to
the
castle
my
cave
as
hostages
for
the
fidelity
of
those
five
and
that
if
they
proved
unfaithful
in
the
execution
the
five
hostages
should
be
hanged
in
chains
alive
on
the
shore
this
looked
severe
and
convinced
them
that
the
governor
was
in
earnest
however
they
had
no
way
left
them
but
to
accept
it
and
it
was
now
the
business
of
the
prisoners
as
much
as
of
the
captain
to
persuade
the
other
five
to
do
their
duty
our
strength
was
now
thus
ordered
for
the
expedition
first
the
captain
his
mate
and
passenger
second
the
two
prisoners
of
the
first
gang
to
whom
having
their
character
from
the
captain
i
had
given
their
liberty
and
trusted
them
with
arms
third
the
other
two
that
i
had
kept
till
now
in
my
bower
pinioned
but
on
the
captain
s
motion
had
now
released
fourth
these
five
released
at
last
so
that
there
were
twelve
in
all
besides
five
we
kept
prisoners
in
the
cave
for
hostages
i
asked
the
captain
if
he
was
willing
to
venture
with
these
hands
on
board
the
ship
but
as
for
me
and
my
man
friday
i
did
not
think
it
was
proper
for
us
to
stir
having
seven
men
left
behind
and
it
was
employment
enough
for
us
to
keep
them
asunder
and
supply
them
with
victuals
as
to
the
five
in
the
cave
i
resolved
to
keep
them
fast
but
friday
went
in
twice
a
day
to
them
to
supply
them
with
necessaries
and
i
made
the
other
two
carry
provisions
to
a
certain
distance
where
friday
was
to
take
them
when
i
showed
myself
to
the
two
hostages
it
was
with
the
captain
who
told
them
i
was
the
person
the
governor
had
ordered
to
look
after
them
and
that
it
was
the
governor
s
pleasure
they
should
not
stir
anywhere
but
by
my
direction
that
if
they
did
they
would
be
fetched
into
the
castle
and
be
laid
in
irons
so
that
as
we
never
suffered
them
to
see
me
as
governor
i
now
appeared
as
another
person
and
spoke
of
the
governor
the
garrison
the
castle
and
the
like
upon
all
occasions
the
captain
now
had
no
difficulty
before
him
but
to
furnish
his
two
boats
stop
the
breach
of
one
and
man
them
he
made
his
passenger
captain
of
one
with
four
of
the
men
and
himself
his
mate
and
five
more
went
in
the
other
and
they
contrived
their
business
very
well
for
they
came
up
to
the
ship
about
midnight
as
soon
as
they
came
within
call
of
the
ship
he
made
robinson
hail
them
and
tell
them
they
had
brought
off
the
men
and
the
boat
but
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
had
found
them
and
the
like
holding
them
in
a
chat
till
they
came
to
the
ship
s
side
when
the
captain
and
the
mate
entering
first
with
their
arms
immediately
knocked
down
the
second
mate
and
carpenter
with
the
butt
end
of
their
muskets
being
very
faithfully
seconded
by
their
men
they
secured
all
the
rest
that
were
upon
the
main
and
quarter
decks
and
began
to
fasten
the
hatches
to
keep
them
down
that
were
below
when
the
other
boat
and
their
men
entering
at
the
forechains
secured
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
and
the
scuttle
which
went
down
into
the
cook
room
making
three
men
they
found
there
prisoners
when
this
was
done
and
all
safe
upon
deck
the
captain
ordered
the
mate
with
three
men
to
break
into
the
round
house
where
the
new
rebel
captain
lay
who
having
taken
the
alarm
had
got
up
and
with
two
men
and
a
boy
had
got
firearms
in
their
hands
and
when
the
mate
with
a
crow
split
open
the
door
the
new
captain
and
his
men
fired
boldly
among
them
and
wounded
the
mate
with
a
musket
ball
which
broke
his
arm
and
wounded
two
more
of
the
men
but
killed
nobody
the
mate
calling
for
help
rushed
however
into
the
round
house
wounded
as
he
was
and
with
his
pistol
shot
the
new
captain
through
the
head
the
bullet
entering
at
his
mouth
and
came
out
again
behind
one
of
his
ears
so
that
he
never
spoke
a
word
more
upon
which
the
rest
yielded
and
the
ship
was
taken
effectually
without
any
more
lives
lost
as
soon
as
the
ship
was
thus
secured
the
captain
ordered
seven
guns
to
be
fired
which
was
the
signal
agreed
upon
with
me
to
give
me
notice
of
his
success
which
you
may
be
sure
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
having
sat
watching
upon
the
shore
for
it
till
near
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
having
thus
heard
the
signal
plainly
i
laid
me
down
and
it
having
been
a
day
of
great
fatigue
to
me
i
slept
very
sound
till
i
was
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
and
presently
starting
up
i
heard
a
man
call
me
by
the
name
of
governor
governor
and
presently
i
knew
the
captain
s
voice
when
climbing
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
there
he
stood
and
pointing
to
the
ship
he
embraced
me
in
his
arms
my
dear
friend
and
deliverer
says
he
there
s
your
ship
for
she
is
all
yours
and
so
are
we
and
all
that
belong
to
her
i
cast
my
eyes
to
the
ship
and
there
she
rode
within
little
more
than
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
for
they
had
weighed
her
anchor
as
soon
as
they
were
masters
of
her
and
the
weather
being
fair
had
brought
her
to
an
anchor
just
against
the
mouth
of
the
little
creek
and
the
tide
being
up
the
captain
had
brought
the
pinnace
in
near
the
place
where
i
had
first
landed
my
rafts
and
so
landed
just
at
my
door
i
was
at
first
ready
to
sink
down
with
the
surprise
for
i
saw
my
deliverance
indeed
visibly
put
into
my
hands
all
things
easy
and
a
large
ship
just
ready
to
carry
me
away
whither
i
pleased
to
go
at
first
for
some
time
i
was
not
able
to
answer
him
one
word
but
as
he
had
taken
me
in
his
arms
i
held
fast
by
him
or
i
should
have
fallen
to
the
ground
he
perceived
the
surprise
and
immediately
pulled
a
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
me
a
dram
of
cordial
which
he
had
brought
on
purpose
for
me
after
i
had
drunk
it
i
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
though
it
brought
me
to
myself
yet
it
was
a
good
while
before
i
could
speak
a
word
to
him
all
this
time
the
poor
man
was
in
as
great
an
ecstasy
as
i
only
not
under
any
surprise
as
i
was
and
he
said
a
thousand
kind
and
tender
things
to
me
to
compose
and
bring
me
to
myself
but
such
was
the
flood
of
joy
in
my
breast
that
it
put
all
my
spirits
into
confusion
at
last
it
broke
out
into
tears
and
in
a
little
while
after
i
recovered
my
speech
i
then
took
my
turn
and
embraced
him
as
my
deliverer
and
we
rejoiced
together
i
told
him
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
sent
by
heaven
to
deliver
me
and
that
the
whole
transaction
seemed
to
be
a
chain
of
wonders
that
such
things
as
these
were
the
testimonies
we
had
of
a
secret
hand
of
providence
governing
the
world
and
an
evidence
that
the
eye
of
an
infinite
power
could
search
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
world
and
send
help
to
the
miserable
whenever
he
pleased
i
forgot
not
to
lift
up
my
heart
in
thankfulness
to
heaven
and
what
heart
could
forbear
to
bless
him
who
had
not
only
in
a
miraculous
manner
provided
for
me
in
such
a
wilderness
and
in
such
a
desolate
condition
but
from
whom
every
deliverance
must
always
be
acknowledged
to
proceed
when
we
had
talked
a
while
the
captain
told
me
he
had
brought
me
some
little
refreshment
such
as
the
ship
afforded
and
such
as
the
wretches
that
had
been
so
long
his
masters
had
not
plundered
him
of
upon
this
he
called
aloud
to
the
boat
and
bade
his
men
bring
the
things
ashore
that
were
for
the
governor
and
indeed
it
was
a
present
as
if
i
had
been
one
that
was
not
to
be
carried
away
with
them
but
as
if
i
had
been
to
dwell
upon
the
island
still
first
he
had
brought
me
a
case
of
bottles
full
of
excellent
cordial
waters
six
large
bottles
of
madeira
wine
the
bottles
held
two
quarts
each
two
pounds
of
excellent
good
tobacco
twelve
good
pieces
of
the
ship
s
beef
and
six
pieces
of
pork
with
a
bag
of
peas
and
about
a
hundred
weight
of
biscuit
he
also
brought
me
a
box
of
sugar
a
box
of
flour
a
bag
full
of
lemons
and
two
bottles
of
lime
juice
and
abundance
of
other
things
but
besides
these
and
what
was
a
thousand
times
more
useful
to
me
he
brought
me
six
new
clean
shirts
six
very
good
neckcloths
two
pair
of
gloves
one
pair
of
shoes
a
hat
and
one
pair
of
stockings
with
a
very
good
suit
of
clothes
of
his
own
which
had
been
worn
but
very
little
in
a
word
he
clothed
me
from
head
to
foot
it
was
a
very
kind
and
agreeable
present
as
any
one
may
imagine
to
one
in
my
circumstances
but
never
was
anything
in
the
world
of
that
kind
so
unpleasant
awkward
and
uneasy
as
it
was
to
me
to
wear
such
clothes
at
first
after
these
ceremonies
were
past
and
after
all
his
good
things
were
brought
into
my
little
apartment
we
began
to
consult
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
prisoners
we
had
for
it
was
worth
considering
whether
we
might
venture
to
take
them
with
us
or
no
especially
two
of
them
whom
he
knew
to
be
incorrigible
and
refractory
to
the
last
degree
and
the
captain
said
he
knew
they
were
such
rogues
that
there
was
no
obliging
them
and
if
he
did
carry
them
away
it
must
be
in
irons
as
malefactors
to
be
delivered
over
to
justice
at
the
first
english
colony
he
could
come
to
and
i
found
that
the
captain
himself
was
very
anxious
about
it
upon
this
i
told
him
that
if
he
desired
it
i
would
undertake
to
bring
the
two
men
he
spoke
of
to
make
it
their
own
request
that
he
should
leave
them
upon
the
island
i
should
be
very
glad
of
that
says
the
captain
with
all
my
heart
well
says
i
i
will
send
for
them
up
and
talk
with
them
for
you
so
i
caused
friday
and
the
two
hostages
for
they
were
now
discharged
their
comrades
having
performed
their
promise
i
say
i
caused
them
to
go
to
the
cave
and
bring
up
the
five
men
pinioned
as
they
were
to
the
bower
and
keep
them
there
till
i
came
after
some
time
i
came
thither
dressed
in
my
new
habit
and
now
i
was
called
governor
again
being
all
met
and
the
captain
with
me
i
caused
the
men
to
be
brought
before
me
and
i
told
them
i
had
got
a
full
account
of
their
villainous
behaviour
to
the
captain
and
how
they
had
run
away
with
the
ship
and
were
preparing
to
commit
further
robberies
but
that
providence
had
ensnared
them
in
their
own
ways
and
that
they
were
fallen
into
the
pit
which
they
had
dug
for
others
i
let
them
know
that
by
my
direction
the
ship
had
been
seized
that
she
lay
now
in
the
road
and
they
might
see
by
and
by
that
their
new
captain
had
received
the
reward
of
his
villainy
and
that
they
would
see
him
hanging
at
the
yard
arm
that
as
to
them
i
wanted
to
know
what
they
had
to
say
why
i
should
not
execute
them
as
pirates
taken
in
the
fact
as
by
my
commission
they
could
not
doubt
but
i
had
authority
so
to
do
one
of
them
answered
in
the
name
of
the
rest
that
they
had
nothing
to
say
but
this
that
when
they
were
taken
the
captain
promised
them
their
lives
and
they
humbly
implored
my
mercy
but
i
told
them
i
knew
not
what
mercy
to
show
them
for
as
for
myself
i
had
resolved
to
quit
the
island
with
all
my
men
and
had
taken
passage
with
the
captain
to
go
to
england
and
as
for
the
captain
he
could
not
carry
them
to
england
other
than
as
prisoners
in
irons
to
be
tried
for
mutiny
and
running
away
with
the
ship
the
consequence
of
which
they
must
needs
know
would
be
the
gallows
so
that
i
could
not
tell
what
was
best
for
them
unless
they
had
a
mind
to
take
their
fate
in
the
island
if
they
desired
that
as
i
had
liberty
to
leave
the
island
i
had
some
inclination
to
give
them
their
lives
if
they
thought
they
could
shift
on
shore
they
seemed
very
thankful
for
it
and
said
they
would
much
rather
venture
to
stay
there
than
be
carried
to
england
to
be
hanged
so
i
left
it
on
that
issue
however
the
captain
seemed
to
make
some
difficulty
of
it
as
if
he
durst
not
leave
them
there
upon
this
i
seemed
a
little
angry
with
the
captain
and
told
him
that
they
were
my
prisoners
not
his
and
that
seeing
i
had
offered
them
so
much
favour
i
would
be
as
good
as
my
word
and
that
if
he
did
not
think
fit
to
consent
to
it
i
would
set
them
at
liberty
as
i
found
them
and
if
he
did
not
like
it
he
might
take
them
again
if
he
could
catch
them
upon
this
they
appeared
very
thankful
and
i
accordingly
set
them
at
liberty
and
bade
them
retire
into
the
woods
to
the
place
whence
they
came
and
i
would
leave
them
some
firearms
some
ammunition
and
some
directions
how
they
should
live
very
well
if
they
thought
fit
upon
this
i
prepared
to
go
on
board
the
ship
but
told
the
captain
i
would
stay
that
night
to
prepare
my
things
and
desired
him
to
go
on
board
in
the
meantime
and
keep
all
right
in
the
ship
and
send
the
boat
on
shore
next
day
for
me
ordering
him
at
all
events
to
cause
the
new
captain
who
was
killed
to
be
hanged
at
the
yard
arm
that
these
men
might
see
him
when
the
captain
was
gone
i
sent
for
the
men
up
to
me
to
my
apartment
and
entered
seriously
into
discourse
with
them
on
their
circumstances
i
told
them
i
thought
they
had
made
a
right
choice
that
if
the
captain
had
carried
them
away
they
would
certainly
be
hanged
i
showed
them
the
new
captain
hanging
at
the
yard
arm
of
the
ship
and
told
them
they
had
nothing
less
to
expect
when
they
had
all
declared
their
willingness
to
stay
i
then
told
them
i
would
let
them
into
the
story
of
my
living
there
and
put
them
into
the
way
of
making
it
easy
to
them
accordingly
i
gave
them
the
whole
history
of
the
place
and
of
my
coming
to
it
showed
them
my
fortifications
the
way
i
made
my
bread
planted
my
corn
cured
my
grapes
and
in
a
word
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
them
easy
i
told
them
the
story
also
of
the
seventeen
spaniards
that
were
to
be
expected
for
whom
i
left
a
letter
and
made
them
promise
to
treat
them
in
common
with
themselves
here
it
may
be
noted
that
the
captain
who
had
ink
on
board
was
greatly
surprised
that
i
never
hit
upon
a
way
of
making
ink
of
charcoal
and
water
or
of
something
else
as
i
had
done
things
much
more
difficult
i
left
them
my
firearms
viz
five
muskets
three
fowling
pieces
and
three
swords
i
had
above
a
barrel
and
a
half
of
powder
left
for
after
the
first
year
or
two
i
used
but
little
and
wasted
none
i
gave
them
a
description
of
the
way
i
managed
the
goats
and
directions
to
milk
and
fatten
them
and
to
make
both
butter
and
cheese
in
a
word
i
gave
them
every
part
of
my
own
story
and
told
them
i
should
prevail
with
the
captain
to
leave
them
two
barrels
of
gunpowder
more
and
some
garden
seeds
which
i
told
them
i
would
have
been
very
glad
of
also
i
gave
them
the
bag
of
peas
which
the
captain
had
brought
me
to
eat
and
bade
them
be
sure
to
sow
and
increase
them
chapter
xix
return
to
england
having
done
all
this
i
left
them
the
next
day
and
went
on
board
the
ship
we
prepared
immediately
to
sail
but
did
not
weigh
that
night
the
next
morning
early
two
of
the
five
men
came
swimming
to
the
ship
s
side
and
making
the
most
lamentable
complaint
of
the
other
three
begged
to
be
taken
into
the
ship
for
god
s
sake
for
they
should
be
murdered
and
begged
the
captain
to
take
them
on
board
though
he
hanged
them
immediately
upon
this
the
captain
pretended
to
have
no
power
without
me
but
after
some
difficulty
and
after
their
solemn
promises
of
amendment
they
were
taken
on
board
and
were
some
time
after
soundly
whipped
and
pickled
after
which
they
proved
very
honest
and
quiet
fellows
some
time
after
this
the
boat
was
ordered
on
shore
the
tide
being
up
with
the
things
promised
to
the
men
to
which
the
captain
at
my
intercession
caused
their
chests
and
clothes
to
be
added
which
they
took
and
were
very
thankful
for
i
also
encouraged
them
by
telling
them
that
if
it
lay
in
my
power
to
send
any
vessel
to
take
them
in
i
would
not
forget
them
when
i
took
leave
of
this
island
i
carried
on
board
for
relics
the
great
goat
skin
cap
i
had
made
my
umbrella
and
one
of
my
parrots
also
i
forgot
not
to
take
the
money
i
formerly
mentioned
which
had
lain
by
me
so
long
useless
that
it
was
grown
rusty
or
tarnished
and
could
hardly
pass
for
silver
till
it
had
been
a
little
rubbed
and
handled
as
also
the
money
i
found
in
the
wreck
of
the
spanish
ship
and
thus
i
left
the
island
the
th
of
december
as
i
found
by
the
ship
s
account
in
the
year
after
i
had
been
upon
it
eight
and
twenty
years
two
months
and
nineteen
days
being
delivered
from
this
second
captivity
the
same
day
of
the
month
that
i
first
made
my
escape
in
the
long
boat
from
among
the
moors
of
sallee
in
this
vessel
after
a
long
voyage
i
arrived
in
england
the
th
of
june
in
the
year
having
been
thirty
five
years
absent
when
i
came
to
england
i
was
as
perfect
a
stranger
to
all
the
world
as
if
i
had
never
been
known
there
my
benefactor
and
faithful
steward
whom
i
had
left
my
money
in
trust
with
was
alive
but
had
had
great
misfortunes
in
the
world
was
become
a
widow
the
second
time
and
very
low
in
the
world
i
made
her
very
easy
as
to
what
she
owed
me
assuring
her
i
would
give
her
no
trouble
but
on
the
contrary
in
gratitude
for
her
former
care
and
faithfulness
to
me
i
relieved
her
as
my
little
stock
would
afford
which
at
that
time
would
indeed
allow
me
to
do
but
little
for
her
but
i
assured
her
i
would
never
forget
her
former
kindness
to
me
nor
did
i
forget
her
when
i
had
sufficient
to
help
her
as
shall
be
observed
in
its
proper
place
i
went
down
afterwards
into
yorkshire
but
my
father
was
dead
and
my
mother
and
all
the
family
extinct
except
that
i
found
two
sisters
and
two
of
the
children
of
one
of
my
brothers
and
as
i
had
been
long
ago
given
over
for
dead
there
had
been
no
provision
made
for
me
so
that
in
a
word
i
found
nothing
to
relieve
or
assist
me
and
that
the
little
money
i
had
would
not
do
much
for
me
as
to
settling
in
the
world
i
met
with
one
piece
of
gratitude
indeed
which
i
did
not
expect
and
this
was
that
the
master
of
the
ship
whom
i
had
so
happily
delivered
and
by
the
same
means
saved
the
ship
and
cargo
having
given
a
very
handsome
account
to
the
owners
of
the
manner
how
i
had
saved
the
lives
of
the
men
and
the
ship
they
invited
me
to
meet
them
and
some
other
merchants
concerned
and
all
together
made
me
a
very
handsome
compliment
upon
the
subject
and
a
present
of
almost
sterling
but
after
making
several
reflections
upon
the
circumstances
of
my
life
and
how
little
way
this
would
go
towards
settling
me
in
the
world
i
resolved
to
go
to
lisbon
and
see
if
i
might
not
come
at
some
information
of
the
state
of
my
plantation
in
the
brazils
and
of
what
was
become
of
my
partner
who
i
had
reason
to
suppose
had
some
years
past
given
me
over
for
dead
with
this
view
i
took
shipping
for
lisbon
where
i
arrived
in
april
following
my
man
friday
accompanying
me
very
honestly
in
all
these
ramblings
and
proving
a
most
faithful
servant
upon
all
occasions
when
i
came
to
lisbon
i
found
out
by
inquiry
and
to
my
particular
satisfaction
my
old
friend
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
first
took
me
up
at
sea
off
the
shore
of
africa
he
was
now
grown
old
and
had
left
off
going
to
sea
having
put
his
son
who
was
far
from
a
young
man
into
his
ship
and
who
still
used
the
brazil
trade
the
old
man
did
not
know
me
and
indeed
i
hardly
knew
him
but
i
soon
brought
him
to
my
remembrance
and
as
soon
brought
myself
to
his
remembrance
when
i
told
him
who
i
was
after
some
passionate
expressions
of
the
old
acquaintance
between
us
i
inquired
you
may
be
sure
after
my
plantation
and
my
partner
the
old
man
told
me
he
had
not
been
in
the
brazils
for
about
nine
years
but
that
he
could
assure
me
that
when
he
came
away
my
partner
was
living
but
the
trustees
whom
i
had
joined
with
him
to
take
cognisance
of
my
part
were
both
dead
that
however
he
believed
i
would
have
a
very
good
account
of
the
improvement
of
the
plantation
for
that
upon
the
general
belief
of
my
being
cast
away
and
drowned
my
trustees
had
given
in
the
account
of
the
produce
of
my
part
of
the
plantation
to
the
procurator
fiscal
who
had
appropriated
it
in
case
i
never
came
to
claim
it
one
third
to
the
king
and
two
thirds
to
the
monastery
of
st
augustine
to
be
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
and
for
the
conversion
of
the
indians
to
the
catholic
faith
but
that
if
i
appeared
or
any
one
for
me
to
claim
the
inheritance
it
would
be
restored
only
that
the
improvement
or
annual
production
being
distributed
to
charitable
uses
could
not
be
restored
but
he
assured
me
that
the
steward
of
the
king
s
revenue
from
lands
and
the
providore
or
steward
of
the
monastery
had
taken
great
care
all
along
that
the
incumbent
that
is
to
say
my
partner
gave
every
year
a
faithful
account
of
the
produce
of
which
they
had
duly
received
my
moiety
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
to
what
height
of
improvement
he
had
brought
the
plantation
and
whether
he
thought
it
might
be
worth
looking
after
or
whether
on
my
going
thither
i
should
meet
with
any
obstruction
to
my
possessing
my
just
right
in
the
moiety
he
told
me
he
could
not
tell
exactly
to
what
degree
the
plantation
was
improved
but
this
he
knew
that
my
partner
was
grown
exceeding
rich
upon
the
enjoying
his
part
of
it
and
that
to
the
best
of
his
remembrance
he
had
heard
that
the
king
s
third
of
my
part
which
was
it
seems
granted
away
to
some
other
monastery
or
religious
house
amounted
to
above
two
hundred
moidores
a
year
that
as
to
my
being
restored
to
a
quiet
possession
of
it
there
was
no
question
to
be
made
of
that
my
partner
being
alive
to
witness
my
title
and
my
name
being
also
enrolled
in
the
register
of
the
country
also
he
told
me
that
the
survivors
of
my
two
trustees
were
very
fair
honest
people
and
very
wealthy
and
he
believed
i
would
not
only
have
their
assistance
for
putting
me
in
possession
but
would
find
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
in
their
hands
for
my
account
being
the
produce
of
the
farm
while
their
fathers
held
the
trust
and
before
it
was
given
up
as
above
which
as
he
remembered
was
for
about
twelve
years
i
showed
myself
a
little
concerned
and
uneasy
at
this
account
and
inquired
of
the
old
captain
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
trustees
should
thus
dispose
of
my
effects
when
he
knew
that
i
had
made
my
will
and
had
made
him
the
portuguese
captain
my
universal
heir
c
he
told
me
that
was
true
but
that
as
there
was
no
proof
of
my
being
dead
he
could
not
act
as
executor
until
some
certain
account
should
come
of
my
death
and
besides
he
was
not
willing
to
intermeddle
with
a
thing
so
remote
that
it
was
true
he
had
registered
my
will
and
put
in
his
claim
and
could
he
have
given
any
account
of
my
being
dead
or
alive
he
would
have
acted
by
procuration
and
taken
possession
of
the
ingenio
so
they
call
the
sugar
house
and
have
given
his
son
who
was
now
at
the
brazils
orders
to
do
it
but
says
the
old
man
i
have
one
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
which
perhaps
may
not
be
so
acceptable
to
you
as
the
rest
and
that
is
believing
you
were
lost
and
all
the
world
believing
so
also
your
partner
and
trustees
did
offer
to
account
with
me
in
your
name
for
the
first
six
or
eight
years
profits
which
i
received
there
being
at
that
time
great
disbursements
for
increasing
the
works
building
an
ingenio
and
buying
slaves
it
did
not
amount
to
near
so
much
as
afterwards
it
produced
however
says
the
old
man
i
shall
give
you
a
true
account
of
what
i
have
received
in
all
and
how
i
have
disposed
of
it
after
a
few
days
further
conference
with
this
ancient
friend
he
brought
me
an
account
of
the
first
six
years
income
of
my
plantation
signed
by
my
partner
and
the
merchant
trustees
being
always
delivered
in
goods
viz
tobacco
in
roll
and
sugar
in
chests
besides
rum
molasses
c
which
is
the
consequence
of
a
sugar
work
and
i
found
by
this
account
that
every
year
the
income
considerably
increased
but
as
above
the
disbursements
being
large
the
sum
at
first
was
small
however
the
old
man
let
me
see
that
he
was
debtor
to
me
four
hundred
and
seventy
moidores
of
gold
besides
sixty
chests
of
sugar
and
fifteen
double
rolls
of
tobacco
which
were
lost
in
his
ship
he
having
been
shipwrecked
coming
home
to
lisbon
about
eleven
years
after
my
having
the
place
the
good
man
then
began
to
complain
of
his
misfortunes
and
how
he
had
been
obliged
to
make
use
of
my
money
to
recover
his
losses
and
buy
him
a
share
in
a
new
ship
however
my
old
friend
says
he
you
shall
not
want
a
supply
in
your
necessity
and
as
soon
as
my
son
returns
you
shall
be
fully
satisfied
upon
this
he
pulls
out
an
old
pouch
and
gives
me
one
hundred
and
sixty
portugal
moidores
in
gold
and
giving
the
writings
of
his
title
to
the
ship
which
his
son
was
gone
to
the
brazils
in
of
which
he
was
quarter
part
owner
and
his
son
another
he
puts
them
both
into
my
hands
for
security
of
the
rest
i
was
too
much
moved
with
the
honesty
and
kindness
of
the
poor
man
to
be
able
to
bear
this
and
remembering
what
he
had
done
for
me
how
he
had
taken
me
up
at
sea
and
how
generously
he
had
used
me
on
all
occasions
and
particularly
how
sincere
a
friend
he
was
now
to
me
i
could
hardly
refrain
weeping
at
what
he
had
said
to
me
therefore
i
asked
him
if
his
circumstances
admitted
him
to
spare
so
much
money
at
that
time
and
if
it
would
not
straiten
him
he
told
me
he
could
not
say
but
it
might
straiten
him
a
little
but
however
it
was
my
money
and
i
might
want
it
more
than
he
everything
the
good
man
said
was
full
of
affection
and
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
tears
while
he
spoke
in
short
i
took
one
hundred
of
the
moidores
and
called
for
a
pen
and
ink
to
give
him
a
receipt
for
them
then
i
returned
him
the
rest
and
told
him
if
ever
i
had
possession
of
the
plantation
i
would
return
the
other
to
him
also
as
indeed
i
afterwards
did
and
that
as
to
the
bill
of
sale
of
his
part
in
his
son
s
ship
i
would
not
take
it
by
any
means
but
that
if
i
wanted
the
money
i
found
he
was
honest
enough
to
pay
me
and
if
i
did
not
but
came
to
receive
what
he
gave
me
reason
to
expect
i
would
never
have
a
penny
more
from
him
when
this
was
past
the
old
man
asked
me
if
he
should
put
me
into
a
method
to
make
my
claim
to
my
plantation
i
told
him
i
thought
to
go
over
to
it
myself
he
said
i
might
do
so
if
i
pleased
but
that
if
i
did
not
there
were
ways
enough
to
secure
my
right
and
immediately
to
appropriate
the
profits
to
my
use
and
as
there
were
ships
in
the
river
of
lisbon
just
ready
to
go
away
to
brazil
he
made
me
enter
my
name
in
a
public
register
with
his
affidavit
affirming
upon
oath
that
i
was
alive
and
that
i
was
the
same
person
who
took
up
the
land
for
the
planting
the
said
plantation
at
first
this
being
regularly
attested
by
a
notary
and
a
procuration
affixed
he
directed
me
to
send
it
with
a
letter
of
his
writing
to
a
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
at
the
place
and
then
proposed
my
staying
with
him
till
an
account
came
of
the
return
never
was
anything
more
honourable
than
the
proceedings
upon
this
procuration
for
in
less
than
seven
months
i
received
a
large
packet
from
the
survivors
of
my
trustees
the
merchants
for
whose
account
i
went
to
sea
in
which
were
the
following
particular
letters
and
papers
enclosed
first
there
was
the
account
current
of
the
produce
of
my
farm
or
plantation
from
the
year
when
their
fathers
had
balanced
with
my
old
portugal
captain
being
for
six
years
the
balance
appeared
to
be
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
seventy
four
moidores
in
my
favour
secondly
there
was
the
account
of
four
years
more
while
they
kept
the
effects
in
their
hands
before
the
government
claimed
the
administration
as
being
the
effects
of
a
person
not
to
be
found
which
they
called
civil
death
and
the
balance
of
this
the
value
of
the
plantation
increasing
amounted
to
nineteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty
six
crusadoes
being
about
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
forty
moidores
thirdly
there
was
the
prior
of
st
augustine
s
account
who
had
received
the
profits
for
above
fourteen
years
but
not
being
able
to
account
for
what
was
disposed
of
by
the
hospital
very
honestly
declared
he
had
eight
hundred
and
seventy
two
moidores
not
distributed
which
he
acknowledged
to
my
account
as
to
the
king
s
part
that
refunded
nothing
there
was
a
letter
of
my
partner
s
congratulating
me
very
affectionately
upon
my
being
alive
giving
me
an
account
how
the
estate
was
improved
and
what
it
produced
a
year
with
the
particulars
of
the
number
of
squares
or
acres
that
it
contained
how
planted
how
many
slaves
there
were
upon
it
and
making
two
and
twenty
crosses
for
blessings
told
me
he
had
said
so
many
ave
marias
to
thank
the
blessed
virgin
that
i
was
alive
inviting
me
very
passionately
to
come
over
and
take
possession
of
my
own
and
in
the
meantime
to
give
him
orders
to
whom
he
should
deliver
my
effects
if
i
did
not
come
myself
concluding
with
a
hearty
tender
of
his
friendship
and
that
of
his
family
and
sent
me
as
a
present
seven
fine
leopards
skins
which
he
had
it
seems
received
from
africa
by
some
other
ship
that
he
had
sent
thither
and
which
it
seems
had
made
a
better
voyage
than
i
he
sent
me
also
five
chests
of
excellent
sweetmeats
and
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
uncoined
not
quite
so
large
as
moidores
by
the
same
fleet
my
two
merchant
trustees
shipped
me
one
thousand
two
hundred
chests
of
sugar
eight
hundred
rolls
of
tobacco
and
the
rest
of
the
whole
account
in
gold
i
might
well
say
now
indeed
that
the
latter
end
of
job
was
better
than
the
beginning
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
flutterings
of
my
very
heart
when
i
found
all
my
wealth
about
me
for
as
the
brazil
ships
come
all
in
fleets
the
same
ships
which
brought
my
letters
brought
my
goods
and
the
effects
were
safe
in
the
river
before
the
letters
came
to
my
hand
in
a
word
i
turned
pale
and
grew
sick
and
had
not
the
old
man
run
and
fetched
me
a
cordial
i
believe
the
sudden
surprise
of
joy
had
overset
nature
and
i
had
died
upon
the
spot
nay
after
that
i
continued
very
ill
and
was
so
some
hours
till
a
physician
being
sent
for
and
something
of
the
real
cause
of
my
illness
being
known
he
ordered
me
to
be
let
blood
after
which
i
had
relief
and
grew
well
but
i
verily
believe
if
i
had
not
been
eased
by
a
vent
given
in
that
manner
to
the
spirits
i
should
have
died
i
was
now
master
all
on
a
sudden
of
above
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
in
money
and
had
an
estate
as
i
might
well
call
it
in
the
brazils
of
above
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
as
sure
as
an
estate
of
lands
in
england
and
in
a
word
i
was
in
a
condition
which
i
scarce
knew
how
to
understand
or
how
to
compose
myself
for
the
enjoyment
of
it
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
recompense
my
original
benefactor
my
good
old
captain
who
had
been
first
charitable
to
me
in
my
distress
kind
to
me
in
my
beginning
and
honest
to
me
at
the
end
i
showed
him
all
that
was
sent
to
me
i
told
him
that
next
to
the
providence
of
heaven
which
disposed
all
things
it
was
owing
to
him
and
that
it
now
lay
on
me
to
reward
him
which
i
would
do
a
hundred
fold
so
i
first
returned
to
him
the
hundred
moidores
i
had
received
of
him
then
i
sent
for
a
notary
and
caused
him
to
draw
up
a
general
release
or
discharge
from
the
four
hundred
and
seventy
moidores
which
he
had
acknowledged
he
owed
me
in
the
fullest
and
firmest
manner
possible
after
which
i
caused
a
procuration
to
be
drawn
empowering
him
to
be
the
receiver
of
the
annual
profits
of
my
plantation
and
appointing
my
partner
to
account
with
him
and
make
the
returns
by
the
usual
fleets
to
him
in
my
name
and
by
a
clause
in
the
end
made
a
grant
of
one
hundred
moidores
a
year
to
him
during
his
life
out
of
the
effects
and
fifty
moidores
a
year
to
his
son
after
him
for
his
life
and
thus
i
requited
my
old
man
i
had
now
to
consider
which
way
to
steer
my
course
next
and
what
to
do
with
the
estate
that
providence
had
thus
put
into
my
hands
and
indeed
i
had
more
care
upon
my
head
now
than
i
had
in
my
state
of
life
in
the
island
where
i
wanted
nothing
but
what
i
had
and
had
nothing
but
what
i
wanted
whereas
i
had
now
a
great
charge
upon
me
and
my
business
was
how
to
secure
it
i
had
not
a
cave
now
to
hide
my
money
in
or
a
place
where
it
might
lie
without
lock
or
key
till
it
grew
mouldy
and
tarnished
before
anybody
would
meddle
with
it
on
the
contrary
i
knew
not
where
to
put
it
or
whom
to
trust
with
it
my
old
patron
the
captain
indeed
was
honest
and
that
was
the
only
refuge
i
had
in
the
next
place
my
interest
in
the
brazils
seemed
to
summon
me
thither
but
now
i
could
not
tell
how
to
think
of
going
thither
till
i
had
settled
my
affairs
and
left
my
effects
in
some
safe
hands
behind
me
at
first
i
thought
of
my
old
friend
the
widow
who
i
knew
was
honest
and
would
be
just
to
me
but
then
she
was
in
years
and
but
poor
and
for
aught
i
knew
might
be
in
debt
so
that
in
a
word
i
had
no
way
but
to
go
back
to
england
myself
and
take
my
effects
with
me
it
was
some
months
however
before
i
resolved
upon
this
and
therefore
as
i
had
rewarded
the
old
captain
fully
and
to
his
satisfaction
who
had
been
my
former
benefactor
so
i
began
to
think
of
the
poor
widow
whose
husband
had
been
my
first
benefactor
and
she
while
it
was
in
her
power
my
faithful
steward
and
instructor
so
the
first
thing
i
did
i
got
a
merchant
in
lisbon
to
write
to
his
correspondent
in
london
not
only
to
pay
a
bill
but
to
go
find
her
out
and
carry
her
in
money
a
hundred
pounds
from
me
and
to
talk
with
her
and
comfort
her
in
her
poverty
by
telling
her
she
should
if
i
lived
have
a
further
supply
at
the
same
time
i
sent
my
two
sisters
in
the
country
a
hundred
pounds
each
they
being
though
not
in
want
yet
not
in
very
good
circumstances
one
having
been
married
and
left
a
widow
and
the
other
having
a
husband
not
so
kind
to
her
as
he
should
be
but
among
all
my
relations
or
acquaintances
i
could
not
yet
pitch
upon
one
to
whom
i
durst
commit
the
gross
of
my
stock
that
i
might
go
away
to
the
brazils
and
leave
things
safe
behind
me
and
this
greatly
perplexed
me
i
had
once
a
mind
to
have
gone
to
the
brazils
and
have
settled
myself
there
for
i
was
as
it
were
naturalised
to
the
place
but
i
had
some
little
scruple
in
my
mind
about
religion
which
insensibly
drew
me
back
however
it
was
not
religion
that
kept
me
from
going
there
for
the
present
and
as
i
had
made
no
scruple
of
being
openly
of
the
religion
of
the
country
all
the
while
i
was
among
them
so
neither
did
i
yet
only
that
now
and
then
having
of
late
thought
more
of
it
than
formerly
when
i
began
to
think
of
living
and
dying
among
them
i
began
to
regret
having
professed
myself
a
papist
and
thought
it
might
not
be
the
best
religion
to
die
with
but
as
i
have
said
this
was
not
the
main
thing
that
kept
me
from
going
to
the
brazils
but
that
really
i
did
not
know
with
whom
to
leave
my
effects
behind
me
so
i
resolved
at
last
to
go
to
england
where
if
i
arrived
i
concluded
that
i
should
make
some
acquaintance
or
find
some
relations
that
would
be
faithful
to
me
and
accordingly
i
prepared
to
go
to
england
with
all
my
wealth
in
order
to
prepare
things
for
my
going
home
i
first
the
brazil
fleet
being
just
going
away
resolved
to
give
answers
suitable
to
the
just
and
faithful
account
of
things
i
had
from
thence
and
first
to
the
prior
of
st
augustine
i
wrote
a
letter
full
of
thanks
for
his
just
dealings
and
the
offer
of
the
eight
hundred
and
seventy
two
moidores
which
were
undisposed
of
which
i
desired
might
be
given
five
hundred
to
the
monastery
and
three
hundred
and
seventy
two
to
the
poor
as
the
prior
should
direct
desiring
the
good
padre
s
prayers
for
me
and
the
like
i
wrote
next
a
letter
of
thanks
to
my
two
trustees
with
all
the
acknowledgment
that
so
much
justice
and
honesty
called
for
as
for
sending
them
any
present
they
were
far
above
having
any
occasion
of
it
lastly
i
wrote
to
my
partner
acknowledging
his
industry
in
the
improving
the
plantation
and
his
integrity
in
increasing
the
stock
of
the
works
giving
him
instructions
for
his
future
government
of
my
part
according
to
the
powers
i
had
left
with
my
old
patron
to
whom
i
desired
him
to
send
whatever
became
due
to
me
till
he
should
hear
from
me
more
particularly
assuring
him
that
it
was
my
intention
not
only
to
come
to
him
but
to
settle
myself
there
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
to
this
i
added
a
very
handsome
present
of
some
italian
silks
for
his
wife
and
two
daughters
for
such
the
captain
s
son
informed
me
he
had
with
two
pieces
of
fine
english
broadcloth
the
best
i
could
get
in
lisbon
five
pieces
of
black
baize
and
some
flanders
lace
of
a
good
value
having
thus
settled
my
affairs
sold
my
cargo
and
turned
all
my
effects
into
good
bills
of
exchange
my
next
difficulty
was
which
way
to
go
to
england
i
had
been
accustomed
enough
to
the
sea
and
yet
i
had
a
strange
aversion
to
go
to
england
by
the
sea
at
that
time
and
yet
i
could
give
no
reason
for
it
yet
the
difficulty
increased
upon
me
so
much
that
though
i
had
once
shipped
my
baggage
in
order
to
go
yet
i
altered
my
mind
and
that
not
once
but
two
or
three
times
it
is
true
i
had
been
very
unfortunate
by
sea
and
this
might
be
one
of
the
reasons
but
let
no
man
slight
the
strong
impulses
of
his
own
thoughts
in
cases
of
such
moment
two
of
the
ships
which
i
had
singled
out
to
go
in
i
mean
more
particularly
singled
out
than
any
other
having
put
my
things
on
board
one
of
them
and
in
the
other
having
agreed
with
the
captain
i
say
two
of
these
ships
miscarried
one
was
taken
by
the
algerines
and
the
other
was
lost
on
the
start
near
torbay
and
all
the
people
drowned
except
three
so
that
in
either
of
those
vessels
i
had
been
made
miserable
having
been
thus
harassed
in
my
thoughts
my
old
pilot
to
whom
i
communicated
everything
pressed
me
earnestly
not
to
go
by
sea
but
either
to
go
by
land
to
the
groyne
and
cross
over
the
bay
of
biscay
to
rochelle
from
whence
it
was
but
an
easy
and
safe
journey
by
land
to
paris
and
so
to
calais
and
dover
or
to
go
up
to
madrid
and
so
all
the
way
by
land
through
france
in
a
word
i
was
so
prepossessed
against
my
going
by
sea
at
all
except
from
calais
to
dover
that
i
resolved
to
travel
all
the
way
by
land
which
as
i
was
not
in
haste
and
did
not
value
the
charge
was
by
much
the
pleasanter
way
and
to
make
it
more
so
my
old
captain
brought
an
english
gentleman
the
son
of
a
merchant
in
lisbon
who
was
willing
to
travel
with
me
after
which
we
picked
up
two
more
english
merchants
also
and
two
young
portuguese
gentlemen
the
last
going
to
paris
only
so
that
in
all
there
were
six
of
us
and
five
servants
the
two
merchants
and
the
two
portuguese
contenting
themselves
with
one
servant
between
two
to
save
the
charge
and
as
for
me
i
got
an
english
sailor
to
travel
with
me
as
a
servant
besides
my
man
friday
who
was
too
much
a
stranger
to
be
capable
of
supplying
the
place
of
a
servant
on
the
road
in
this
manner
i
set
out
from
lisbon
and
our
company
being
very
well
mounted
and
armed
we
made
a
little
troop
whereof
they
did
me
the
honour
to
call
me
captain
as
well
because
i
was
the
oldest
man
as
because
i
had
two
servants
and
indeed
was
the
origin
of
the
whole
journey
as
i
have
troubled
you
with
none
of
my
sea
journals
so
i
shall
trouble
you
now
with
none
of
my
land
journals
but
some
adventures
that
happened
to
us
in
this
tedious
and
difficult
journey
i
must
not
omit
when
we
came
to
madrid
we
being
all
of
us
strangers
to
spain
were
willing
to
stay
some
time
to
see
the
court
of
spain
and
what
was
worth
observing
but
it
being
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
we
hastened
away
and
set
out
from
madrid
about
the
middle
of
october
but
when
we
came
to
the
edge
of
navarre
we
were
alarmed
at
several
towns
on
the
way
with
an
account
that
so
much
snow
was
falling
on
the
french
side
of
the
mountains
that
several
travellers
were
obliged
to
come
back
to
pampeluna
after
having
attempted
at
an
extreme
hazard
to
pass
on
when
we
came
to
pampeluna
itself
we
found
it
so
indeed
and
to
me
that
had
been
always
used
to
a
hot
climate
and
to
countries
where
i
could
scarce
bear
any
clothes
on
the
cold
was
insufferable
nor
indeed
was
it
more
painful
than
surprising
to
come
but
ten
days
before
out
of
old
castile
where
the
weather
was
not
only
warm
but
very
hot
and
immediately
to
feel
a
wind
from
the
pyrenean
mountains
so
very
keen
so
severely
cold
as
to
be
intolerable
and
to
endanger
benumbing
and
perishing
of
our
fingers
and
toes
poor
friday
was
really
frightened
when
he
saw
the
mountains
all
covered
with
snow
and
felt
cold
weather
which
he
had
never
seen
or
felt
before
in
his
life
to
mend
the
matter
when
we
came
to
pampeluna
it
continued
snowing
with
so
much
violence
and
so
long
that
the
people
said
winter
was
come
before
its
time
and
the
roads
which
were
difficult
before
were
now
quite
impassable
for
in
a
word
the
snow
lay
in
some
places
too
thick
for
us
to
travel
and
being
not
hard
frozen
as
is
the
case
in
the
northern
countries
there
was
no
going
without
being
in
danger
of
being
buried
alive
every
step
we
stayed
no
less
than
twenty
days
at
pampeluna
when
seeing
the
winter
coming
on
and
no
likelihood
of
its
being
better
for
it
was
the
severest
winter
all
over
europe
that
had
been
known
in
the
memory
of
man
i
proposed
that
we
should
go
away
to
fontarabia
and
there
take
shipping
for
bordeaux
which
was
a
very
little
voyage
but
while
i
was
considering
this
there
came
in
four
french
gentlemen
who
having
been
stopped
on
the
french
side
of
the
passes
as
we
were
on
the
spanish
had
found
out
a
guide
who
traversing
the
country
near
the
head
of
languedoc
had
brought
them
over
the
mountains
by
such
ways
that
they
were
not
much
incommoded
with
the
snow
for
where
they
met
with
snow
in
any
quantity
they
said
it
was
frozen
hard
enough
to
bear
them
and
their
horses
we
sent
for
this
guide
who
told
us
he
would
undertake
to
carry
us
the
same
way
with
no
hazard
from
the
snow
provided
we
were
armed
sufficiently
to
protect
ourselves
from
wild
beasts
for
he
said
in
these
great
snows
it
was
frequent
for
some
wolves
to
show
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
being
made
ravenous
for
want
of
food
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
we
told
him
we
were
well
enough
prepared
for
such
creatures
as
they
were
if
he
would
insure
us
from
a
kind
of
two
legged
wolves
which
we
were
told
we
were
in
most
danger
from
especially
on
the
french
side
of
the
mountains
he
satisfied
us
that
there
was
no
danger
of
that
kind
in
the
way
that
we
were
to
go
so
we
readily
agreed
to
follow
him
as
did
also
twelve
other
gentlemen
with
their
servants
some
french
some
spanish
who
as
i
said
had
attempted
to
go
and
were
obliged
to
come
back
again
accordingly
we
set
out
from
pampeluna
with
our
guide
on
the
th
of
november
and
indeed
i
was
surprised
when
instead
of
going
forward
he
came
directly
back
with
us
on
the
same
road
that
we
came
from
madrid
about
twenty
miles
when
having
passed
two
rivers
and
come
into
the
plain
country
we
found
ourselves
in
a
warm
climate
again
where
the
country
was
pleasant
and
no
snow
to
be
seen
but
on
a
sudden
turning
to
his
left
he
approached
the
mountains
another
way
and
though
it
is
true
the
hills
and
precipices
looked
dreadful
yet
he
made
so
many
tours
such
meanders
and
led
us
by
such
winding
ways
that
we
insensibly
passed
the
height
of
the
mountains
without
being
much
encumbered
with
the
snow
and
all
on
a
sudden
he
showed
us
the
pleasant
and
fruitful
provinces
of
languedoc
and
gascony
all
green
and
flourishing
though
at
a
great
distance
and
we
had
some
rough
way
to
pass
still
we
were
a
little
uneasy
however
when
we
found
it
snowed
one
whole
day
and
a
night
so
fast
that
we
could
not
travel
but
he
bid
us
be
easy
we
should
soon
be
past
it
all
we
found
indeed
that
we
began
to
descend
every
day
and
to
come
more
north
than
before
and
so
depending
upon
our
guide
we
went
on
it
was
about
two
hours
before
night
when
our
guide
being
something
before
us
and
not
just
in
sight
out
rushed
three
monstrous
wolves
and
after
them
a
bear
from
a
hollow
way
adjoining
to
a
thick
wood
two
of
the
wolves
made
at
the
guide
and
had
he
been
far
before
us
he
would
have
been
devoured
before
we
could
have
helped
him
one
of
them
fastened
upon
his
horse
and
the
other
attacked
the
man
with
such
violence
that
he
had
not
time
or
presence
of
mind
enough
to
draw
his
pistol
but
hallooed
and
cried
out
to
us
most
lustily
my
man
friday
being
next
me
i
bade
him
ride
up
and
see
what
was
the
matter
as
soon
as
friday
came
in
sight
of
the
man
he
hallooed
out
as
loud
as
the
other
o
master
o
master
but
like
a
bold
fellow
rode
directly
up
to
the
poor
man
and
with
his
pistol
shot
the
wolf
in
the
head
that
attacked
him
it
was
happy
for
the
poor
man
that
it
was
my
man
friday
for
having
been
used
to
such
creatures
in
his
country
he
had
no
fear
upon
him
but
went
close
up
to
him
and
shot
him
whereas
any
other
of
us
would
have
fired
at
a
farther
distance
and
have
perhaps
either
missed
the
wolf
or
endangered
shooting
the
man
but
it
was
enough
to
have
terrified
a
bolder
man
than
i
and
indeed
it
alarmed
all
our
company
when
with
the
noise
of
friday
s
pistol
we
heard
on
both
sides
the
most
dismal
howling
of
wolves
and
the
noise
redoubled
by
the
echo
of
the
mountains
appeared
to
us
as
if
there
had
been
a
prodigious
number
of
them
and
perhaps
there
was
not
such
a
few
as
that
we
had
no
cause
of
apprehension
however
as
friday
had
killed
this
wolf
the
other
that
had
fastened
upon
the
horse
left
him
immediately
and
fled
without
doing
him
any
damage
having
happily
fastened
upon
his
head
where
the
bosses
of
the
bridle
had
stuck
in
his
teeth
but
the
man
was
most
hurt
for
the
raging
creature
had
bit
him
twice
once
in
the
arm
and
the
other
time
a
little
above
his
knee
and
though
he
had
made
some
defence
he
was
just
tumbling
down
by
the
disorder
of
his
horse
when
friday
came
up
and
shot
the
wolf
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
at
the
noise
of
friday
s
pistol
we
all
mended
our
pace
and
rode
up
as
fast
as
the
way
which
was
very
difficult
would
give
us
leave
to
see
what
was
the
matter
as
soon
as
we
came
clear
of
the
trees
which
blinded
us
before
we
saw
clearly
what
had
been
the
case
and
how
friday
had
disengaged
the
poor
guide
though
we
did
not
presently
discern
what
kind
of
creature
it
was
he
had
killed
chapter
xx
fight
between
friday
and
a
bear
but
never
was
a
fight
managed
so
hardily
and
in
such
a
surprising
manner
as
that
which
followed
between
friday
and
the
bear
which
gave
us
all
though
at
first
we
were
surprised
and
afraid
for
him
the
greatest
diversion
imaginable
as
the
bear
is
a
heavy
clumsy
creature
and
does
not
gallop
as
the
wolf
does
who
is
swift
and
light
so
he
has
two
particular
qualities
which
generally
are
the
rule
of
his
actions
first
as
to
men
who
are
not
his
proper
prey
he
does
not
usually
attempt
them
except
they
first
attack
him
unless
he
be
excessively
hungry
which
it
is
probable
might
now
be
the
case
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
if
you
do
not
meddle
with
him
he
will
not
meddle
with
you
but
then
you
must
take
care
to
be
very
civil
to
him
and
give
him
the
road
for
he
is
a
very
nice
gentleman
he
will
not
go
a
step
out
of
his
way
for
a
prince
nay
if
you
are
really
afraid
your
best
way
is
to
look
another
way
and
keep
going
on
for
sometimes
if
you
stop
and
stand
still
and
look
steadfastly
at
him
he
takes
it
for
an
affront
but
if
you
throw
or
toss
anything
at
him
though
it
were
but
a
bit
of
stick
as
big
as
your
finger
he
thinks
himself
abused
and
sets
all
other
business
aside
to
pursue
his
revenge
and
will
have
satisfaction
in
point
of
honour
that
is
his
first
quality
the
next
is
if
he
be
once
affronted
he
will
never
leave
you
night
or
day
till
he
has
his
revenge
but
follows
at
a
good
round
rate
till
he
overtakes
you
my
man
friday
had
delivered
our
guide
and
when
we
came
up
to
him
he
was
helping
him
off
his
horse
for
the
man
was
both
hurt
and
frightened
when
on
a
sudden
we
espied
the
bear
come
out
of
the
wood
and
a
monstrous
one
it
was
the
biggest
by
far
that
ever
i
saw
we
were
all
a
little
surprised
when
we
saw
him
but
when
friday
saw
him
it
was
easy
to
see
joy
and
courage
in
the
fellow
s
countenance
o
o
o
says
friday
three
times
pointing
to
him
o
master
you
give
me
te
leave
me
shakee
te
hand
with
him
me
makee
you
good
laugh
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
fellow
so
well
pleased
you
fool
says
i
he
will
eat
you
up
eatee
me
up
eatee
me
up
says
friday
twice
over
again
me
eatee
him
up
me
makee
you
good
laugh
you
all
stay
here
me
show
you
good
laugh
so
down
he
sits
and
gets
off
his
boots
in
a
moment
and
puts
on
a
pair
of
pumps
as
we
call
the
flat
shoes
they
wear
and
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
gives
my
other
servant
his
horse
and
with
his
gun
away
he
flew
swift
like
the
wind
the
bear
was
walking
softly
on
and
offered
to
meddle
with
nobody
till
friday
coming
pretty
near
calls
to
him
as
if
the
bear
could
understand
him
hark
ye
hark
ye
says
friday
me
speakee
with
you
we
followed
at
a
distance
for
now
being
down
on
the
gascony
side
of
the
mountains
we
were
entered
a
vast
forest
where
the
country
was
plain
and
pretty
open
though
it
had
many
trees
in
it
scattered
here
and
there
friday
who
had
as
we
say
the
heels
of
the
bear
came
up
with
him
quickly
and
took
up
a
great
stone
and
threw
it
at
him
and
hit
him
just
on
the
head
but
did
him
no
more
harm
than
if
he
had
thrown
it
against
a
wall
but
it
answered
friday
s
end
for
the
rogue
was
so
void
of
fear
that
he
did
it
purely
to
make
the
bear
follow
him
and
show
us
some
laugh
as
he
called
it
as
soon
as
the
bear
felt
the
blow
and
saw
him
he
turns
about
and
comes
after
him
taking
very
long
strides
and
shuffling
on
at
a
strange
rate
so
as
would
have
put
a
horse
to
a
middling
gallop
away
reins
friday
and
takes
his
course
as
if
he
ran
towards
us
for
help
so
we
all
resolved
to
fire
at
once
upon
the
bear
and
deliver
my
man
though
i
was
angry
at
him
for
bringing
the
bear
back
upon
us
when
he
was
going
about
his
own
business
another
way
and
especially
i
was
angry
that
he
had
turned
the
bear
upon
us
and
then
ran
away
and
i
called
out
you
dog
is
this
your
making
us
laugh
come
away
and
take
your
horse
that
we
may
shoot
the
creature
he
heard
me
and
cried
out
no
shoot
no
shoot
stand
still
and
you
get
much
laugh
and
as
the
nimble
creature
ran
two
feet
for
the
bear
s
one
he
turned
on
a
sudden
on
one
side
of
us
and
seeing
a
great
oak
tree
fit
for
his
purpose
he
beckoned
to
us
to
follow
and
doubling
his
pace
he
got
nimbly
up
the
tree
laying
his
gun
down
upon
the
ground
at
about
five
or
six
yards
from
the
bottom
of
the
tree
the
bear
soon
came
to
the
tree
and
we
followed
at
a
distance
the
first
thing
he
did
he
stopped
at
the
gun
smelt
at
it
but
let
it
lie
and
up
he
scrambles
into
the
tree
climbing
like
a
cat
though
so
monstrous
heavy
i
was
amazed
at
the
folly
as
i
thought
it
of
my
man
and
could
not
for
my
life
see
anything
to
laugh
at
till
seeing
the
bear
get
up
the
tree
we
all
rode
near
to
him
when
we
came
to
the
tree
there
was
friday
got
out
to
the
small
end
of
a
large
branch
and
the
bear
got
about
half
way
to
him
as
soon
as
the
bear
got
out
to
that
part
where
the
limb
of
the
tree
was
weaker
ha
says
he
to
us
now
you
see
me
teachee
the
bear
dance
so
he
began
jumping
and
shaking
the
bough
at
which
the
bear
began
to
totter
but
stood
still
and
began
to
look
behind
him
to
see
how
he
should
get
back
then
indeed
we
did
laugh
heartily
but
friday
had
not
done
with
him
by
a
great
deal
when
seeing
him
stand
still
he
called
out
to
him
again
as
if
he
had
supposed
the
bear
could
speak
english
what
you
come
no
farther
pray
you
come
farther
so
he
left
jumping
and
shaking
the
tree
and
the
bear
just
as
if
he
understood
what
he
said
did
come
a
little
farther
then
he
began
jumping
again
and
the
bear
stopped
again
we
thought
now
was
a
good
time
to
knock
him
in
the
head
and
called
to
friday
to
stand
still
and
we
should
shoot
the
bear
but
he
cried
out
earnestly
oh
pray
oh
pray
no
shoot
me
shoot
by
and
then
he
would
have
said
by
and
by
however
to
shorten
the
story
friday
danced
so
much
and
the
bear
stood
so
ticklish
that
we
had
laughing
enough
but
still
could
not
imagine
what
the
fellow
would
do
for
first
we
thought
he
depended
upon
shaking
the
bear
off
and
we
found
the
bear
was
too
cunning
for
that
too
for
he
would
not
go
out
far
enough
to
be
thrown
down
but
clung
fast
with
his
great
broad
claws
and
feet
so
that
we
could
not
imagine
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
what
the
jest
would
be
at
last
but
friday
put
us
out
of
doubt
quickly
for
seeing
the
bear
cling
fast
to
the
bough
and
that
he
would
not
be
persuaded
to
come
any
farther
well
well
says
friday
you
no
come
farther
me
go
you
no
come
to
me
me
come
to
you
and
upon
this
he
went
out
to
the
smaller
end
where
it
would
bend
with
his
weight
and
gently
let
himself
down
by
it
sliding
down
the
bough
till
he
came
near
enough
to
jump
down
on
his
feet
and
away
he
ran
to
his
gun
took
it
up
and
stood
still
well
said
i
to
him
friday
what
will
you
do
now
why
don
t
you
shoot
him
no
shoot
says
friday
no
yet
me
shoot
now
me
no
kill
me
stay
give
you
one
more
laugh
and
indeed
so
he
did
for
when
the
bear
saw
his
enemy
gone
he
came
back
from
the
bough
where
he
stood
but
did
it
very
cautiously
looking
behind
him
every
step
and
coming
backward
till
he
got
into
the
body
of
the
tree
then
with
the
same
hinder
end
foremost
he
came
down
the
tree
grasping
it
with
his
claws
and
moving
one
foot
at
a
time
very
leisurely
at
this
juncture
and
just
before
he
could
set
his
hind
foot
on
the
ground
friday
stepped
up
close
to
him
clapped
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
into
his
ear
and
shot
him
dead
then
the
rogue
turned
about
to
see
if
we
did
not
laugh
and
when
he
saw
we
were
pleased
by
our
looks
he
began
to
laugh
very
loud
so
we
kill
bear
in
my
country
says
friday
so
you
kill
them
says
i
why
you
have
no
guns
no
says
he
no
gun
but
shoot
great
much
long
arrow
this
was
a
good
diversion
to
us
but
we
were
still
in
a
wild
place
and
our
guide
very
much
hurt
and
what
to
do
we
hardly
knew
the
howling
of
wolves
ran
much
in
my
head
and
indeed
except
the
noise
i
once
heard
on
the
shore
of
africa
of
which
i
have
said
something
already
i
never
heard
anything
that
filled
me
with
so
much
horror
these
things
and
the
approach
of
night
called
us
off
or
else
as
friday
would
have
had
us
we
should
certainly
have
taken
the
skin
of
this
monstrous
creature
off
which
was
worth
saving
but
we
had
near
three
leagues
to
go
and
our
guide
hastened
us
so
we
left
him
and
went
forward
on
our
journey
the
ground
was
still
covered
with
snow
though
not
so
deep
and
dangerous
as
on
the
mountains
and
the
ravenous
creatures
as
we
heard
afterwards
were
come
down
into
the
forest
and
plain
country
pressed
by
hunger
to
seek
for
food
and
had
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
the
villages
where
they
surprised
the
country
people
killed
a
great
many
of
their
sheep
and
horses
and
some
people
too
we
had
one
dangerous
place
to
pass
and
our
guide
told
us
if
there
were
more
wolves
in
the
country
we
should
find
them
there
and
this
was
a
small
plain
surrounded
with
woods
on
every
side
and
a
long
narrow
defile
or
lane
which
we
were
to
pass
to
get
through
the
wood
and
then
we
should
come
to
the
village
where
we
were
to
lodge
it
was
within
half
an
hour
of
sunset
when
we
entered
the
wood
and
a
little
after
sunset
when
we
came
into
the
plain
we
met
with
nothing
in
the
first
wood
except
that
in
a
little
plain
within
the
wood
which
was
not
above
two
furlongs
over
we
saw
five
great
wolves
cross
the
road
full
speed
one
after
another
as
if
they
had
been
in
chase
of
some
prey
and
had
it
in
view
they
took
no
notice
of
us
and
were
gone
out
of
sight
in
a
few
moments
upon
this
our
guide
who
by
the
way
was
but
a
fainthearted
fellow
bid
us
keep
in
a
ready
posture
for
he
believed
there
were
more
wolves
a
coming
we
kept
our
arms
ready
and
our
eyes
about
us
but
we
saw
no
more
wolves
till
we
came
through
that
wood
which
was
near
half
a
league
and
entered
the
plain
as
soon
as
we
came
into
the
plain
we
had
occasion
enough
to
look
about
us
the
first
object
we
met
with
was
a
dead
horse
that
is
to
say
a
poor
horse
which
the
wolves
had
killed
and
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
at
work
we
could
not
say
eating
him
but
picking
his
bones
rather
for
they
had
eaten
up
all
the
flesh
before
we
did
not
think
fit
to
disturb
them
at
their
feast
neither
did
they
take
much
notice
of
us
friday
would
have
let
fly
at
them
but
i
would
not
suffer
him
by
any
means
for
i
found
we
were
like
to
have
more
business
upon
our
hands
than
we
were
aware
of
we
had
not
gone
half
over
the
plain
when
we
began
to
hear
the
wolves
howl
in
the
wood
on
our
left
in
a
frightful
manner
and
presently
after
we
saw
about
a
hundred
coming
on
directly
towards
us
all
in
a
body
and
most
of
them
in
a
line
as
regularly
as
an
army
drawn
up
by
experienced
officers
i
scarce
knew
in
what
manner
to
receive
them
but
found
to
draw
ourselves
in
a
close
line
was
the
only
way
so
we
formed
in
a
moment
but
that
we
might
not
have
too
much
interval
i
ordered
that
only
every
other
man
should
fire
and
that
the
others
who
had
not
fired
should
stand
ready
to
give
them
a
second
volley
immediately
if
they
continued
to
advance
upon
us
and
then
that
those
that
had
fired
at
first
should
not
pretend
to
load
their
fusees
again
but
stand
ready
every
one
with
a
pistol
for
we
were
all
armed
with
a
fusee
and
a
pair
of
pistols
each
man
so
we
were
by
this
method
able
to
fire
six
volleys
half
of
us
at
a
time
however
at
present
we
had
no
necessity
for
upon
firing
the
first
volley
the
enemy
made
a
full
stop
being
terrified
as
well
with
the
noise
as
with
the
fire
four
of
them
being
shot
in
the
head
dropped
several
others
were
wounded
and
went
bleeding
off
as
we
could
see
by
the
snow
i
found
they
stopped
but
did
not
immediately
retreat
whereupon
remembering
that
i
had
been
told
that
the
fiercest
creatures
were
terrified
at
the
voice
of
a
man
i
caused
all
the
company
to
halloo
as
loud
as
they
could
and
i
found
the
notion
not
altogether
mistaken
for
upon
our
shout
they
began
to
retire
and
turn
about
i
then
ordered
a
second
volley
to
be
fired
in
their
rear
which
put
them
to
the
gallop
and
away
they
went
to
the
woods
this
gave
us
leisure
to
charge
our
pieces
again
and
that
we
might
lose
no
time
we
kept
going
but
we
had
but
little
more
than
loaded
our
fusees
and
put
ourselves
in
readiness
when
we
heard
a
terrible
noise
in
the
same
wood
on
our
left
only
that
it
was
farther
onward
the
same
way
we
were
to
go
the
night
was
coming
on
and
the
light
began
to
be
dusky
which
made
it
worse
on
our
side
but
the
noise
increasing
we
could
easily
perceive
that
it
was
the
howling
and
yelling
of
those
hellish
creatures
and
on
a
sudden
we
perceived
three
troops
of
wolves
one
on
our
left
one
behind
us
and
one
in
our
front
so
that
we
seemed
to
be
surrounded
with
them
however
as
they
did
not
fall
upon
us
we
kept
our
way
forward
as
fast
as
we
could
make
our
horses
go
which
the
way
being
very
rough
was
only
a
good
hard
trot
in
this
manner
we
came
in
view
of
the
entrance
of
a
wood
through
which
we
were
to
pass
at
the
farther
side
of
the
plain
but
we
were
greatly
surprised
when
coming
nearer
the
lane
or
pass
we
saw
a
confused
number
of
wolves
standing
just
at
the
entrance
on
a
sudden
at
another
opening
of
the
wood
we
heard
the
noise
of
a
gun
and
looking
that
way
out
rushed
a
horse
with
a
saddle
and
a
bridle
on
him
flying
like
the
wind
and
sixteen
or
seventeen
wolves
after
him
full
speed
the
horse
had
the
advantage
of
them
but
as
we
supposed
that
he
could
not
hold
it
at
that
rate
we
doubted
not
but
they
would
get
up
with
him
at
last
no
question
but
they
did
but
here
we
had
a
most
horrible
sight
for
riding
up
to
the
entrance
where
the
horse
came
out
we
found
the
carcasses
of
another
horse
and
of
two
men
devoured
by
the
ravenous
creatures
and
one
of
the
men
was
no
doubt
the
same
whom
we
heard
fire
the
gun
for
there
lay
a
gun
just
by
him
fired
off
but
as
to
the
man
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
was
eaten
up
this
filled
us
with
horror
and
we
knew
not
what
course
to
take
but
the
creatures
resolved
us
soon
for
they
gathered
about
us
presently
in
hopes
of
prey
and
i
verily
believe
there
were
three
hundred
of
them
it
happened
very
much
to
our
advantage
that
at
the
entrance
into
the
wood
but
a
little
way
from
it
there
lay
some
large
timber
trees
which
had
been
cut
down
the
summer
before
and
i
suppose
lay
there
for
carriage
i
drew
my
little
troop
in
among
those
trees
and
placing
ourselves
in
a
line
behind
one
long
tree
i
advised
them
all
to
alight
and
keeping
that
tree
before
us
for
a
breastwork
to
stand
in
a
triangle
or
three
fronts
enclosing
our
horses
in
the
centre
we
did
so
and
it
was
well
we
did
for
never
was
a
more
furious
charge
than
the
creatures
made
upon
us
in
this
place
they
came
on
with
a
growling
kind
of
noise
and
mounted
the
piece
of
timber
which
as
i
said
was
our
breastwork
as
if
they
were
only
rushing
upon
their
prey
and
this
fury
of
theirs
it
seems
was
principally
occasioned
by
their
seeing
our
horses
behind
us
i
ordered
our
men
to
fire
as
before
every
other
man
and
they
took
their
aim
so
sure
that
they
killed
several
of
the
wolves
at
the
first
volley
but
there
was
a
necessity
to
keep
a
continual
firing
for
they
came
on
like
devils
those
behind
pushing
on
those
before
when
we
had
fired
a
second
volley
of
our
fusees
we
thought
they
stopped
a
little
and
i
hoped
they
would
have
gone
off
but
it
was
but
a
moment
for
others
came
forward
again
so
we
fired
two
volleys
of
our
pistols
and
i
believe
in
these
four
firings
we
had
killed
seventeen
or
eighteen
of
them
and
lamed
twice
as
many
yet
they
came
on
again
i
was
loth
to
spend
our
shot
too
hastily
so
i
called
my
servant
not
my
man
friday
for
he
was
better
employed
for
with
the
greatest
dexterity
imaginable
he
had
charged
my
fusee
and
his
own
while
we
were
engaged
but
as
i
said
i
called
my
other
man
and
giving
him
a
horn
of
powder
i
had
him
lay
a
train
all
along
the
piece
of
timber
and
let
it
be
a
large
train
he
did
so
and
had
but
just
time
to
get
away
when
the
wolves
came
up
to
it
and
some
got
upon
it
when
i
snapping
an
unchanged
pistol
close
to
the
powder
set
it
on
fire
those
that
were
upon
the
timber
were
scorched
with
it
and
six
or
seven
of
them
fell
or
rather
jumped
in
among
us
with
the
force
and
fright
of
the
fire
we
despatched
these
in
an
instant
and
the
rest
were
so
frightened
with
the
light
which
the
night
for
it
was
now
very
near
dark
made
more
terrible
that
they
drew
back
a
little
upon
which
i
ordered
our
last
pistols
to
be
fired
off
in
one
volley
and
after
that
we
gave
a
shout
upon
this
the
wolves
turned
tail
and
we
sallied
immediately
upon
near
twenty
lame
ones
that
we
found
struggling
on
the
ground
and
fell
to
cutting
them
with
our
swords
which
answered
our
expectation
for
the
crying
and
howling
they
made
was
better
understood
by
their
fellows
so
that
they
all
fled
and
left
us
we
had
first
and
last
killed
about
threescore
of
them
and
had
it
been
daylight
we
had
killed
many
more
the
field
of
battle
being
thus
cleared
we
made
forward
again
for
we
had
still
near
a
league
to
go
we
heard
the
ravenous
creatures
howl
and
yell
in
the
woods
as
we
went
several
times
and
sometimes
we
fancied
we
saw
some
of
them
but
the
snow
dazzling
our
eyes
we
were
not
certain
in
about
an
hour
more
we
came
to
the
town
where
we
were
to
lodge
which
we
found
in
a
terrible
fright
and
all
in
arms
for
it
seems
the
night
before
the
wolves
and
some
bears
had
broken
into
the
village
and
put
them
in
such
terror
that
they
were
obliged
to
keep
guard
night
and
day
but
especially
in
the
night
to
preserve
their
cattle
and
indeed
their
people
the
next
morning
our
guide
was
so
ill
and
his
limbs
swelled
so
much
with
the
rankling
of
his
two
wounds
that
he
could
go
no
farther
so
we
were
obliged
to
take
a
new
guide
here
and
go
to
toulouse
where
we
found
a
warm
climate
a
fruitful
pleasant
country
and
no
snow
no
wolves
nor
anything
like
them
but
when
we
told
our
story
at
toulouse
they
told
us
it
was
nothing
but
what
was
ordinary
in
the
great
forest
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
especially
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
but
they
inquired
much
what
kind
of
guide
we
had
got
who
would
venture
to
bring
us
that
way
in
such
a
severe
season
and
told
us
it
was
surprising
we
were
not
all
devoured
when
we
told
them
how
we
placed
ourselves
and
the
horses
in
the
middle
they
blamed
us
exceedingly
and
told
us
it
was
fifty
to
one
but
we
had
been
all
destroyed
for
it
was
the
sight
of
the
horses
which
made
the
wolves
so
furious
seeing
their
prey
and
that
at
other
times
they
are
really
afraid
of
a
gun
but
being
excessively
hungry
and
raging
on
that
account
the
eagerness
to
come
at
the
horses
had
made
them
senseless
of
danger
and
that
if
we
had
not
by
the
continual
fire
and
at
last
by
the
stratagem
of
the
train
of
powder
mastered
them
it
had
been
great
odds
but
that
we
had
been
torn
to
pieces
whereas
had
we
been
content
to
have
sat
still
on
horseback
and
fired
as
horsemen
they
would
not
have
taken
the
horses
so
much
for
their
own
when
men
were
on
their
backs
as
otherwise
and
withal
they
told
us
that
at
last
if
we
had
stood
altogether
and
left
our
horses
they
would
have
been
so
eager
to
have
devoured
them
that
we
might
have
come
off
safe
especially
having
our
firearms
in
our
hands
being
so
many
in
number
for
my
part
i
was
never
so
sensible
of
danger
in
my
life
for
seeing
above
three
hundred
devils
come
roaring
and
open
mouthed
to
devour
us
and
having
nothing
to
shelter
us
or
retreat
to
i
gave
myself
over
for
lost
and
as
it
was
i
believe
i
shall
never
care
to
cross
those
mountains
again
i
think
i
would
much
rather
go
a
thousand
leagues
by
sea
though
i
was
sure
to
meet
with
a
storm
once
a
week
i
have
nothing
uncommon
to
take
notice
of
in
my
passage
through
france
nothing
but
what
other
travellers
have
given
an
account
of
with
much
more
advantage
than
i
can
i
travelled
from
toulouse
to
paris
and
without
any
considerable
stay
came
to
calais
and
landed
safe
at
dover
the
th
of
january
after
having
had
a
severe
cold
season
to
travel
in
i
was
now
come
to
the
centre
of
my
travels
and
had
in
a
little
time
all
my
new
discovered
estate
safe
about
me
the
bills
of
exchange
which
i
brought
with
me
having
been
currently
paid
my
principal
guide
and
privy
counsellor
was
my
good
ancient
widow
who
in
gratitude
for
the
money
i
had
sent
her
thought
no
pains
too
much
nor
care
too
great
to
employ
for
me
and
i
trusted
her
so
entirely
that
i
was
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
security
of
my
effects
and
indeed
i
was
very
happy
from
the
beginning
and
now
to
the
end
in
the
unspotted
integrity
of
this
good
gentlewoman
and
now
having
resolved
to
dispose
of
my
plantation
in
the
brazils
i
wrote
to
my
old
friend
at
lisbon
who
having
offered
it
to
the
two
merchants
the
survivors
of
my
trustees
who
lived
in
the
brazils
they
accepted
the
offer
and
remitted
thirty
three
thousand
pieces
of
eight
to
a
correspondent
of
theirs
at
lisbon
to
pay
for
it
in
return
i
signed
the
instrument
of
sale
in
the
form
which
they
sent
from
lisbon
and
sent
it
to
my
old
man
who
sent
me
the
bills
of
exchange
for
thirty
two
thousand
eight
hundred
pieces
of
eight
for
the
estate
reserving
the
payment
of
one
hundred
moidores
a
year
to
him
the
old
man
during
his
life
and
fifty
moidores
afterwards
to
his
son
for
his
life
which
i
had
promised
them
and
which
the
plantation
was
to
make
good
as
a
rent
charge
and
thus
i
have
given
the
first
part
of
a
life
of
fortune
and
adventure
a
life
of
providence
s
chequer
work
and
of
a
variety
which
the
world
will
seldom
be
able
to
show
the
like
of
beginning
foolishly
but
closing
much
more
happily
than
any
part
of
it
ever
gave
me
leave
so
much
as
to
hope
for
any
one
would
think
that
in
this
state
of
complicated
good
fortune
i
was
past
running
any
more
hazards
and
so
indeed
i
had
been
if
other
circumstances
had
concurred
but
i
was
inured
to
a
wandering
life
had
no
family
nor
many
relations
nor
however
rich
had
i
contracted
fresh
acquaintance
and
though
i
had
sold
my
estate
in
the
brazils
yet
i
could
not
keep
that
country
out
of
my
head
and
had
a
great
mind
to
be
upon
the
wing
again
especially
i
could
not
resist
the
strong
inclination
i
had
to
see
my
island
and
to
know
if
the
poor
spaniards
were
in
being
there
my
true
friend
the
widow
earnestly
dissuaded
me
from
it
and
so
far
prevailed
with
me
that
for
almost
seven
years
she
prevented
my
running
abroad
during
which
time
i
took
my
two
nephews
the
children
of
one
of
my
brothers
into
my
care
the
eldest
having
something
of
his
own
i
bred
up
as
a
gentleman
and
gave
him
a
settlement
of
some
addition
to
his
estate
after
my
decease
the
other
i
placed
with
the
captain
of
a
ship
and
after
five
years
finding
him
a
sensible
bold
enterprising
young
fellow
i
put
him
into
a
good
ship
and
sent
him
to
sea
and
this
young
fellow
afterwards
drew
me
in
as
old
as
i
was
to
further
adventures
myself
in
the
meantime
i
in
part
settled
myself
here
for
first
of
all
i
married
and
that
not
either
to
my
disadvantage
or
dissatisfaction
and
had
three
children
two
sons
and
one
daughter
but
my
wife
dying
and
my
nephew
coming
home
with
good
success
from
a
voyage
to
spain
my
inclination
to
go
abroad
and
his
importunity
prevailed
and
engaged
me
to
go
in
his
ship
as
a
private
trader
to
the
east
indies
this
was
in
the
year
in
this
voyage
i
visited
my
new
colony
in
the
island
saw
my
successors
the
spaniards
had
the
old
story
of
their
lives
and
of
the
villains
i
left
there
how
at
first
they
insulted
the
poor
spaniards
how
they
afterwards
agreed
disagreed
united
separated
and
how
at
last
the
spaniards
were
obliged
to
use
violence
with
them
how
they
were
subjected
to
the
spaniards
how
honestly
the
spaniards
used
them
a
history
if
it
were
entered
into
as
full
of
variety
and
wonderful
accidents
as
my
own
part
particularly
also
as
to
their
battles
with
the
caribbeans
who
landed
several
times
upon
the
island
and
as
to
the
improvement
they
made
upon
the
island
itself
and
how
five
of
them
made
an
attempt
upon
the
mainland
and
brought
away
eleven
men
and
five
women
prisoners
by
which
at
my
coming
i
found
about
twenty
young
children
on
the
island
here
i
stayed
about
twenty
days
left
them
supplies
of
all
necessary
things
and
particularly
of
arms
powder
shot
clothes
tools
and
two
workmen
which
i
had
brought
from
england
with
me
viz
a
carpenter
and
a
smith
besides
this
i
shared
the
lands
into
parts
with
them
reserved
to
myself
the
property
of
the
whole
but
gave
them
such
parts
respectively
as
they
agreed
on
and
having
settled
all
things
with
them
and
engaged
them
not
to
leave
the
place
i
left
them
there
from
thence
i
touched
at
the
brazils
from
whence
i
sent
a
bark
which
i
bought
there
with
more
people
to
the
island
and
in
it
besides
other
supplies
i
sent
seven
women
being
such
as
i
found
proper
for
service
or
for
wives
to
such
as
would
take
them
as
to
the
englishmen
i
promised
to
send
them
some
women
from
england
with
a
good
cargo
of
necessaries
if
they
would
apply
themselves
to
planting
which
i
afterwards
could
not
perform
the
fellows
proved
very
honest
and
diligent
after
they
were
mastered
and
had
their
properties
set
apart
for
them
i
sent
them
also
from
the
brazils
five
cows
three
of
them
being
big
with
calf
some
sheep
and
some
hogs
which
when
i
came
again
were
considerably
increased
but
all
these
things
with
an
account
how
three
hundred
caribbees
came
and
invaded
them
and
ruined
their
plantations
and
how
they
fought
with
that
whole
number
twice
and
were
at
first
defeated
and
one
of
them
killed
but
at
last
a
storm
destroying
their
enemies
canoes
they
famished
or
destroyed
almost
all
the
rest
and
renewed
and
recovered
the
possession
of
their
plantation
and
still
lived
upon
the
island
all
these
things
with
some
very
surprising
incidents
in
some
new
adventures
of
my
own
for
ten
years
more
i
